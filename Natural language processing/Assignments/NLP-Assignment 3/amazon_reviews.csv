positive,this thing works well most of the time if you don turn it off and just let it go to sleep mode it dies fairly quickly but you still get couple of days of use out of it if you re not using it hours day at least if you turn it off every time you re done though you can get probably month but at least weeks out of it with moderate use originally bought it to use with my ipad however the case on my ipad wouldn really allow the usb to plug into the charger port wish they made an option to get either usb or usb plug as you get both with this mouse but you have to plug the usb into the usb adapter which makes the usb plug significantly thicker than necessary now use it for my macbook just warning if you want it to scroll like regular mouse you have to change it in the setting of the computer but that macbook problem not problem with this mouse not all of apple setting decisions make sense but that nothing new do really like that can chose to just turn on the mouse with solid red color which preserves battery or turn it on to change colors reduces how much time you get out of the mouse but is cool feature my only complaint is that sometimes the mouse isn tracking perfectly and the cursor is in completely different place than would expect it to be further behind where was moving it to rather than the cursor doing its own thing but that may also be thing have to change on the laptop ,279,1.0

neutral,the good has separate usb dongle that stores away and charges internally ie no need for battery the bad the mouse tracking is very erratic too fast too slow and could not find setting that suited me but what renders it unusable for me is the click latency have to click multiple times on anything to get it to work or end up dragging something don mean to some people may also find this mouse bit too small ymmv up to one taste how they like the changing colors on the mouse light display either just red or it switches colors wish you could turn it off though which unfortunately you can ,112,1.0

neutral,i made the mistake of reading the reviews only after bought the mouse because it had stars with something like reviews so thought it was fine saw few reviews that said the seller tried to bribe them into removing their review that made me really regret buying from such an unethical business don think you should buy this mouse even if you re on budget there much better quality mice out there for even less money than this costs this mouse is very cheaply made as for performance issues for one it way too thin and lightweight when using it it very easy to knock it out of place and click something by mistake because it not heavy enough or grippy enough on the bottom to stay where you put it ve never had this issue with mouse before the tracking sensor is also way too sensitive the cursor still moves when you lift the mouse decent couple centimeters above the surface it on this also makes it very hard to put the cursor where you want it on the screen because it still tracking movement when you lift it up the cord to charge it is pretty short although that not huge issue just sort of disappointing the biggest issue is that the cord does not seem to fit properly into the port on the mouse and takes bit of manhandling it felt like was going to break some of the cheap thin plastic when first plugged it in as for looks the edges where the paint or whatever it is on the top are pretty rough and it even came with some of the paint chipped off bought the light pink mouse it not nearly as light as it is in the pictures it darker and much warmer toned rather than cool light pink like the picture it also not as reflective as the pictures show but that not huge deal you can turn off the rgb lights by the switch on the bottom if you want but it still emits red light when using it wish it didn do that it ugly and probably wastes more power ,360,5.0

positive,this mouse works as advertised the changing lights on the side of it are what drew me in when browsing for new mouse on amazon don really like the slim feel to it feel like my hand would get tired after using it for extended periods of time also was looking for specifically usb mouse and to make this one work with usb you have to use the included adapter which ends up sticking out quite ways on the edge of your computer this is clearly stated in the advertisement just didn pay enough attention when bought the mouse ,99,1.0
positive,the price of this mouse was cheap and you will get just that with this product it serves its purpose ok like the color changing led lights but this mouse is too lightweight for my liking and my hand is too big to fit on the mouse comfortably it feels like there is lag when moving the arrow just an overall not great feel compared to my mouse on my work office computer ,73,4.0

positive, its really great don use it for gaming if you are looking for that review stop here but for other review keeping reading it changes color on its own you can personally change it that bummer it slowly changes color one thing that bothers me is the default red light when you move it the red light appears and it over powers the other changing colors if your fine with the red light then buy it other than that it does its job really pretty too the mouse is matte black so its not shiny just wanted to mention that ,100,5.0

positive,i knew what was getting myself into reading the bad reviews it stops working in few weeks usually hedge my bets especially when product has so many reviews that end up with star rating alas lost this bet the scroll function key feature look for in buying mice stopped responding after few weeks fluke should buy scratcher if so because bought two one white one black and they both failed around the same time wondering if this is actually engineered to perform this way though as seeing many other reviews doing the same thing but people being bribed for star if replaced quite genius actually if you get angry customers to review it promotes product engagement but then the rating can be manipulated by replacing the cheap product and soliciting star review if this indeed is the case bravo brilliant way to get as many positive reviews for subpar product ,150,1.0

positive, needed new cheap mouse and this was on sale and read through lot of reviews saw lot of reviews stating that there was chance that the white version could potentially not be solid white allowing for the lights to show through the mouse through the top well that sounded cool to me so ordered white hoping that mine would also do the same pleased to report that it does so be warned that ordering the white version has chance to do this and apparently often find it fun though also happy to note that there is an inactivity timer on the mouse so when not in use it will conserve it battery power by turning off clicking with the mouse will turn it back on battery life has been good so far too work from home for hrs day and it survives my work day easily just plug it up to charge after work ,154,5.0
negative,i only used it once until it was dead and then charged for hours it wouldn even turn on have tried keeping it plugged in restarting my computer and trying the mouse on different computer and it still doesn work and now of course it passed the time to return or get refund even though it cute mouse it doesn work and frustrated ,63,2.0

positive,my boyfriend got me this as gift to help with my crafting love this color because it goes with my cricut also loved that it came with an adapter for my macbook air these newer macbooks require adapters for anything that is not charging port or the newer charging cords so seeing it come with an adapter is amazing don have to carry around my other adapter and its very easy to use love it thank you so much for thinking of us apple users ,85,1.0
positive,great mouse for the price nice and soft matte feel very quite clicks perfect for working in coffee shop works well on mouse pads and flat surfaces and connected to my computer instantly without needing to instal any type of software note rgb lights are not customizable but still cute as heck and works great ,55,1.0
positive,the pros decent mouse for what needed like that it is rechargeable via usb port and can be used as both wireless and wired when plugged in and recharging the cons these first two are mostly preferences so take them however you wish it sits fairly flat so there isn much arch of your hand to rest on depending on what you are used to in mouse this just makes it slightly less comfortable to use based on my personal preferences secondly it has silent soft click normally when you click mouse you feel and hear the click of the button this feels more like am pressing on touch screen there is no satisfying click nor is there sudden give in the button rather it feels like poking couch cushion this could be what you want in mouse so do with this info what you will this last con is not based on preferences however found that occasionally my cursor will studder step to the left when am moving the mouse to the right with the dual screens have this means that end up with my cursor all the way over on the other end of my work space when trying to get to the right to close tab or select tool in my adobe programs it nothing that has caused too many problems as it only happen every once in awhile but it was enough to stand out and earn it place in this review ,246,5.0

positive,if you want cheap light up mouse then get this one when it on sale definitely not worth the price otherwise it very quiet and slim but that about where the benefits outweigh the cost the actual lighting is not what advertised it actually pretty dim even in dark room beyond that whenever you move the mouse the red laser at the bottom for tracking movement lights up the whole mouse taking over the other colors being displayed additionally with the hour charge time and the usb needed for connectivity you be better off buying nicer mouse for the same price,101,1.0

neutral,when received this product the first time it had come broken the entire click pad was nearly separated from the base and couldn easily be snapped back into place sent in for replacement and everything was all fine they sent replacement no problems this was in april flash forward to december mere eight months the mechanism that holds the scroll wheel somehow snapped apart and the scroll wheel is now useless which makes playing games bit difficult as many games use the scroll wheel when to contact customer service all contact is closed use caution when ordering this mouse at first the replacement had been sent was good despite it not exactly having any sort of indicator as to when the mouse needed to be charged but if the scroll wheel mechanisms are gonna snap easily under potentially hard gaming sessions perhaps pass for something more heavy duty ,148,1.0

positive,i was bit skeptical about it being quiet clicker but was pleased to learn it really is quiet the clicks are greatly muffled and are soft to the click my only complaint is that the scrolling wheel does not click quietly the lights are enjoyable but don display constant stream of colors as they forcibly manually change when moved or clicked they otherwise will rotate when the mouse is left idle overall it really nice mouse to buy and use comfortable and light kind of reminds me of the apple mouse ,91,4.0

neutral,i purchased this mouse for using with macbook pro there is no lag while using it and is compatible with macbook ,21,2.0
neutral,okay understood that having mouse with cool shifting lights was probably going to result in somewhat reduced battery life just didn expect this the mouse seems to have no sleep mode the lights stay on unless it completely switched off and the battery lasts less than two days brand new thought to myself that could make that work by just remembering to plug it in at night because do like how the mouse feels and works except last night plugged it in and this morning hours later it wasn done charging have resorted to just keeping it plugged in all day while using it which kind of defeats the purpose of having wireless mouse in the first place and ties up two usb ports instead of just one shame back to the drawing board on my mouse search ,138,5.0

neutral,i needed wireless mouse for my new macbook pro that only has usb connections this mouse included an adapter that allowed the standard usb bluetooth receiver to be used in the usb port have only had an opportunity to use it in limited situations thus far but it seems very responsive and performed well the led lights are kinda cool but not really needed trying to see if there is way to use the mouse without the led lights on so can conserve the charge on the battery the only concern issue ve had thus far is that the charging cable connection to the mouse and the adapter don seem to be the most secure and couple times it seemed like the connection came loose and the mouse was no longer charging was still using my laptop while the mouse was charging via the usb port as recommended in the user manual the user manual specifically recommends not using plug in charging adapter like for most cell phones because it might overcharge the mouse and damage it it is recommended that you only use the provided cable and charge it via your laptop to avoid overcharging and damaging the mouse not certain how great an option this is since it seems to come loose and stop charging occasionally if continue to use my laptop while trying to charge the mouse we ll see how it goes in the future if it turns out that it was operator error may update my rating overall though the mouse feels good in my hand and it seems to work well doing everything necessary when need it ,273,1.0

negative,just by the logitech and skip the savings from this cheap import bought this to replace wired mouse on my kvm switch and it worked great for two months would plug in to charge using an open usb port on my switch was super convenient turning it off every night while it charged the next day unplug and flip it to the middle setting so lights were not on constantly and was able to use for the whole day hrs no problem then about two weeks ago same usual routine go to use the next day and completely dead revert back to wired mouse and let it charge until lunch hrs later swap back out lights come on for about seconds and again completely dead now out of the return policy not even months later and screwed ,137,5.0

positive, in all honesty there is very little practical value added by colorful light changes for mouse but you know what in this time of the pandemic we can all use bit of quirky and interesting little patches of fun and joy especially visually this little mouse got the gold color because it was the least expensive at the time always brings smile btw it is quiet no noisy clicks the color is beautiful and classic and the feel is very ergonomic and no stress on the hand and fingers if you re still on the fence get one or more if you want to give yourself little and very useful treat ,111,1.0

negative,the battery of this mouse works well haven timed it but have left it on overnight and it stills has battery not gamer but imagine the gaming quality will be affected depending on how strong the bluetooth connection of the mouse is to the pc setup recently switched from laptop that had the standard rectangular port usb to one that needed the adapter usb the adapter that comes with the mouse worked for about minute before it stop functioning so brought out my own adapter from different device and the mouse now works also tested both adapters with wired mouse it suffices to say that it was the mouse adapter that is not working could have gotten faulty one so the problem could be exclusive to me tl dr mouse adapter didn work ur screwed if urs doesn work either and don have an extra one ,146,4.0

positive, was actually about to return the mouse bc it stopped working and couldn find where to replace the batteries had thrown out the box and prob the instruction booklet can remember if it actually came with instruction booklet went to amazon and read the product detail and saw that it rechargeable mouse using usb cable like it small lightweight and comfortable it fit perfectly in my hand and when resting on top of the mouse the mouse didn feel bulky or heavy like the colors changing pretty coollike not battery operated you can charge using standard usb cable like and dislike read that there is silent option to mute click sound have not found it to test but like that there is the option to take the mouse silent after trying to research how to make the mouse silent have still not been able to do so like maybe great that there is sleep mode not sure where to find it or if have really cannot tell the difference the options in the back are off on and something that looks like sun when on the on option think think it in sleep mode bc the light turns red and then turn off but when on the sun mode the lights change dislike when using the mouse at first there are no issues this is the same experience if the mouse is used with usb cable or wireless randomly the mouse will then lag and get stuck needed to turn power on and off few times aside from the minor issue of latency and turning the mouse on and off it ok got this mouse as second mouse bc the original mouse purchased was taken by my son it is def for the more casual user surfing the internet or checking on ems if trying to use for work get mouse little bit more sturdy and reliable ,317,1.0

neutral, update since writing this review they have emailed me twice offering refund if took the review down when didn reply they offered me refund again in return would have to remove the review they stated they were small company and my review was hurting them but with over reviews don see how that possible the light goes off like it is charged however it won turn on more than about seconds ve tried different charging cords and same thing happens don waste your money ,84,5.0

neutral,the photo is misleading only one color shows at time mouse is not as accurate as most ,17,5.0
positive,this mouse looked promising based on all the positive reviews it is light good to hold and has good battery life it is also quiet with exceptions see below its main problem however is that the middle button the scrollwheel becomes unusable after only short amount of use after which the button needs to be pressed repeatedly in order to register button press also compared to the lmb rmb buttons which are sometimes too light and register button presses accidentally the mmb is extremely rigid in comparison it is also very noisy which is ironic as the other two buttons are completely silent it is much more noisy than other mice have used which is about as someone who relies on this button during daily usage this is very frustrating and frankly serious design flaw like to emphasize that the mouse has been treated well not rough also bought the non led version of this mouse and the exact same problem appeared after the same amount of time another drawback is that the mouse does not indicate when the battery is low leaving one to guess when to recharge it it often becomes erratic mouse pointer moves around and does not register movement well requiring power cycle this is occuring on more than one system all in all decent attempt but quite few issues need to be ironed out doubt the many positive reviews for this product have been based on any more than couple of weeks usage as these issues are consistent and appeared after months frankly expect mouse to last significantly longer and also have useable middle mouse button hope these issues get addressed by the manufacturer ,279,5.0
negative,update have been sent emails from the seller begging me to change my review of the emails offered me to do so this explains the positive reviews despite the terrible product the mouse freezes constantly left and right click will work but the mouse will not move this is the worst mouse ve ever had it also goes into sleep mode after minutes of not being used which is annoying and no way to turn it off the light also stays on while in sleep mode which doesn make sense the charge doesn last very long at all charging it every couple of days ,104,5.0

positive,the good looks nice and feels good in your hand the bad the right click button is too sensitive constantly opening up the right click menu the pointer freezes and have to turn the mouse off and on to unfreeze it the ugly ordered silver mouse and got dark gray ,50,5.0
positive,so for anyone wondering charging it is easy if you plug it and the light in the middle is blue that means that it is not fully charged the blue light will turn off after being fully charged mine arrived on monday and on wednesday it turned off plugged it in and took around hours to charge it the light turned off the clicks are silent and is very comfortable to use one thing do not like is the scroller which can be little too hard tend to open many tabs at once at work and while am on pinterest lol but that just me overall is nice mouse and hope it can stay with me forever this is my th mouse in less than year ,126,1.0

neutral,i have had this mouse for all of minutes and am planning on returning it honestly it looks nice and like that it rechargable however it easily one of the worst ve ever used ve used probably different models in my career alone first clicking the mouse requires much stronger force than any other mouse ve used and on top of that it very inconsistent looking through the gaps where the leds show out of can see the mechanical device which actuates the click is tiny plastic arm no chance that will lasts for an expected period of time it seemed to have been packaged fine so don believe it was damaged or doa don buy this ,117,5.0

positive,this is great mouse to have if you are trying to have mouse that can be used on type only device while keeping the option of normal usb open love having it light up and it cool thing to have in my office if you want to use the type port it will need to be attached via adapter the adapter will stick out unfortunately so be careful as you can damage the adapter it does have slot so you can install the dongle not the adapter to the mouse itself the default plug is just normal usb port the mouse feels pretty nice it does feels pretty smooth there is no real lag or drifting with this mouse it does have built in battery which is super nice you are able to just recharge the mouse by plugging it directly into your laptop via micro usb was able to use it for quite some time before the battery died and initial charging only took about hours it does have sleep mode from what can tell to save battery life when you are not using it but it does have an on and off button if you need it the mouse moves pretty well across most surfaces and clicking is pretty responsive im not gamer so can give any recommendations on that the led light works pretty well with the color you can adjust the color via the center button the bottom has pads but they are not the soft silicone like pads it feels like hard material this is plug in play and works great with mac and pc it does not look like it has way of adjusting the dpi but it has pretty good default dpi already so do not see the need to adjust it overall think this is great mouse ,305,1.0

positive,i was looking for mouse to replace my old wireless one with which the scroll wheel wasnt working anymore and found this one am pleasantly surprised by this mouse the click is very quiet yet there is satisfying tactile feel to it though the right click can be bit sensitive but nothing too major think the best feature of this mouse is that it is rechargeable very convenient the mouse can be used while charging and only took about hours to fully charge there is led indicator that turns off to show when the mouse is done charging the mouse will also go into sleep mode after minutes of inactivity to save power overall great mouse ,116,3.0

positive,very cheaply made it was the biggest waste of my money the piece that plugs into the usb port broke in weeks time as was taking it out of the port it can be glued back together but it would have to be done with precision and carefulness not to get glue all over it dont know that its worth it guess this is one of those things that its just better off going with the brand you trust and paying that little bit extra for something you know is not going to come apart because it was poorly constructed it was pretty cool how it lights up it is very lightweight as well which will leave that to your own interpretation ,122,5.0

neutral,i have already ordered the black one and liked it so much orderer another one for my laptop ,18,5.0
neutral,the device looks and feels good the left clicker is very sensitive and mandates that under normal use you keep your hand off of the top of the mouse on the left side or you will accidently left click the coloring is good looking but it is difficult to determine when you need to recharge the short charging cord connects to the computer so you must leave the computer on while recharging the mouse which is inconvenient but the control of the curser is good although occasionally it seems to jump to different place on the screen still not sure why that happens but it is decent value for the money once you teach yourself it quirks ,117,2.0
neutral,as described,2,3.0
neutral,i read lot of the reviews before decide to buy this item so far have no regrets people complain about the mouse turning off and the lights being on so when got the mouse noticed that there was an off button for the lights if you think about it you are saving power when your not using it would recommend the product ,62,5.0

positive,looks feels great love all the colors ,7,2.0
neutral,i really like the feel and look of this mouse love the matte feel and the lights its also very quiet and not clicky wasn expecting that for the price the only issue have is that if you use it with laptop and remove the receiver often the receiver will come apart im not techy enough to figure out how to make it stay together with glue idk whenever take it out the usb drive and the black part separate and its hard to take the drive out of my computer when that happens frustrating will say that it lasted couple months before that happened though if you use it with pc and never remove it itll last longer just wish could get replacement receiver don want to throw the mouse away if the receiver is the only issue with it got it in february and noticed that it glitches bit if its not on mouse pad or about to die which can be annoying but manageable the mouse charges very quickly ,172,5.0

positive,i absolutely love this mouse super handy dandy because not only does it work with my mac it also works with my work laptop which is dell the only thing don like about it is that if you don use it for while it shuts off mean it great because it saves energy so you don have to charge it often but meh ve yet to charge it again used it for days for at least hours each day ,79,4.0

positive,this is the best wireless mouse ve ever used the flat profile keeps my arthritic hand from getting stiff and sore after long use the colors are subtle enough to be fun but not intrusive if you plan to use it with desktop computer be aware that the charging cord is very short so using the mouse while charging may be problem use it with laptop where this is not an obstacle the mouse appears very well made and sturdy ,80,1.0
neutral,works good for child not for people with arthritis,9,5.0
positive,very cool design thanks,4,1.0
neutral,it light and the texture is nice but there are few flaws the mouse can tilt forward lifting the back off the table since there lot of surface area past where it touches the surface of the table the mouse is small which is nice for portability but for my hand size it gets uncomfortable after while the battery charge is good and the lights aren too harsh but by far the most annoying flaw is that it doesn maintain constant mouse button press so if you have to hold and drag something it will just randomly unclick even though you still have the button pressed tested this lot and it always without fail stops holding down on the computer this is unplayable for some games where you have to hold down one of your mouse buttons perhaps just received faulty mouse but for the price it hard to complain too much ,152,5.0
positive,absolutely amazing product cant get use it enough especially with the color light feature the scroll bar is very smooth and the mouse itself fits perfectly in your hand not to mention there is no batteries required since it it rechargeable definitely worth star rating ,45,1.0

negative,the mouse does well use it daily for work it lasts long time between charges and puts itself to sleep when am not using it so battery is not wasted sometimes can go weeks without charging my only complaint is the wheel have had it about months and the wheel started squeaking recently people can hear it in my calls and it sometimes drives me nuts this is my rd wireless mouse the other were different kinds and the wheel stopped working at all was common complaint on those ,89,1.0

negative,love the slimline appearance and the changing colors the colors add sense of fun to normally mundane piece of computer equipment also love the ability to keep it one color red or allow it to change colors and the ability to change the speed of the cursor good product well designed make sure you are aware of the button on the bottom as it is not just an on off switch but has three positions this is now october this mouse broke after little use while traveling the scroll wheel broke inside the mouse making it useless this appears to be poor design and weak point in this item and would now not recommend it have had other computer mice for years without this issue ,125,5.0

positive,its really light weight and you don hear the mouse clicks however the usb blutooth is located at the bottom of the mouse didn have tough enough finger nails to pull the usb out logitech has their blutooth in the mouse where the battery is located but this didn have visible battery so used the tip of knife to pop the usb out almost nicked my hand from the blade getting the usb out you may do better job than me ,81,5.0
positive,there really nothing to dislike about it love the fact that don have to run out and buy batteries every time it starts to act like it not going to work the way it charges is one of the main reasons that bought it rather save the for batteries and get something else instead of worrying if have enough spare batteries have mouse pad that has breathing mode and the mouse goes along with its own pattern to make the two of them an excellent night light of sorts for the amount spent give this mouse also love the fact that it easy to pack it up with my laptop and go anywhere without worrying again if my mouse will run out of power think that there should be more accessories that can charge from usb port rather than lugging around extra batteries ,143,4.0

negative,the metal piece that is attached to the chip on the ubs broke off in my side brand new laptop talking about being sick,24,5.0
positive,honestly feels bit on the cheap side and compared to other similar makes the main difference being led lighting so it adds wow factor to it clicking is also smooth and feels nice and the top down view is pleasing the lighting itself is mostly smooth but blotchy at some points where the color is abrupt rather than seamless transition performance wise it does the job but ergonomically doesn feel as form fitting as gaming mouse really use this as backup work mouse or home mouse where its just to surf the web also the cursor sometimes randomly jumps first time this has happened on mouse so it seems like they really cut costs and marked up the price if were to guess the price if seen the product without price tag probably say its about bucks ,137,1.0

positive,it cool feels pretty smooth and nice light colors but the battery doesn last long ,15,5.0
positive,the usb plug broke and the case around the chip got stuck inside the port can pull the usb out but the case stays inside the port it still useable if put it back in though it also has very high pitched dog whistle kind of noise when it moves especially when it used close to the usb plug it is not silent that for sure have to use music or headphones when use this mouse or it drives me insane it shallow depth is kind of hard on my hand but have arthritis so usually need thicker taller mouse to fill my palm to be comfortable but bought this mouse as backup for my work laptop so don use it as much as use my gaming mouse like that you can still use it when it plugged in to charge if you use longer cable ,146,5.0

positive,the mouse is contained in japanese package but was made in china it comes with the type adapter charging usb cable regular usb mouse receiver and thin instructions ve plugged the type adapter into two different machines with the same result neither laptops read the type directly or through another adapter ve also tried another wireless mouse receiver in the type with the same results none of them work through this adapter other than that issue the mouse works it also goes to sleep so by clicking the mouse one is able to use it again the also other nice feature is that it is wireless with no battery included just plug in the charging cord into an empty usb slot the color changing around the rim of the mouse gives nice touch and although at first the mouse feels long due to it sleek shape it does fit comfortably in the hand it also has plastic like feeling and on the instructions it says to avoid dropping the mouse so it doesn malfunction or break ,176,5.0

neutral,the rose gold color is very pretty and the color changing effect was nice at first but after about an hour of use the colors started to glitch the back end of the mouse was staying yellow and the front continued to change colors there is an option to turn the colors off but you end up with red light that shows up randomly while moving the mouse around it will get the job done but also feels very cheap compared to logitech or name brand get what you pay for in this case ,94,3.0
neutral, like the color thought it was going to have changing colored lights it only close red which was disappointing it also kind of flat and smaller than expected overall mean does what need it to do ,36,5.0
positive,i recently bought new chromebook and wanted wireless mouse to match came across this mouse and after reading the reviews figured id give it try cant say how good it works yet because never recieved the usb adaptor with it and for some reason cant get it to connect wireless im sure ill figure it out but it wouldve been nice to have the wire option as well otherwise its slim which is what wanted and like the lights on it,81,4.0
neutral,this mouse has very poor sensor it will take several seconds to wake up after being inactive for bit and you sometimes have to click the dpi button or mouse buttons several times and shake the mouse for it to wake up the sensor also cannot move fast if try moving the mouse quickly the cursor gets very spastic and starts curving around the screen like deja vu is playing in the background speaking of clicks the left mouse button double clicks quite bit the only thing this mouse has going for it is its design even then the design is uncomfortable since its so flat find better mouse please don torture yourself with this ,115,2.0

negative,i purchased for our office the mouse looked nice and the colors were pretty but mine started having problems just few days later it was unresponsive and jerky for few days then it stopped working despite charging overnight tried charging on different outlets to make sure the outlet wasn bad but it wouldn hold charge and died again within minutes when asked the other employee about his identical mouse different color he said his never seemed to work right and wouldn hold charge used the included cord and tried charging with the computer with hub with power strip and with charging block not included plugged into multiple outlets when returning packaged the items as requested and requested the pick up slip we found the return slip face down on the ground on the sidewalk several feet in front of our office few days later not stuck to the door or in the mailbox mounted next to our front door no one knocked to let us know it was delivered and we wouldn have found it if staff member hadn gone out to sanitize the outside door handles now we have to take it to drop off location because return pickup is going to cost despite the package being ready to send before the return sticker was dropped off am unhappy with both the item and the return and have already ordered similar replacements from another seller ,236,5.0
positive,this light up mouse is great and ve had few similar ones like that this one is rounded on the edges more aesthetically pleasing imo it holds charge for long enough that it not annoying though it would be nice if there was an option to turn the light off while using to save charge even more the options are just on constant red light or cycles through colors clicks are definitely as close to silent as you could get the only thing that is bothering me is that the wheel is squeaking after only weeks of use intend to drop some wd onto it and sure that will fix the problem but don think that should be necessary to begin with overall good choice though immediate update directing wd into the wheel well of the mouse is not easy even using pin dropped the mouse and now the wheel doesn scroll at all it just spins soooooo not great removing star either accept the squeaky wheel or be very careful when trying to oil said wheel because if you drop it it will die ugh,186,4.0

negative,a rechargeable cordless mouse is such good idea and invention you don have to deal with batteries and this mouse seemed not to need recharging for over day great this one bought worked well even though it did something odd and am not sure if it was the mouse or the inexpensive tablet computers that use or maybe the usb splitters that use however it was probably the mouse but after using the mouse normally for few hours the mouse would then not show the arrow on the screen and found that would have to turn off the swatch on the mouse and then turn it back on again it was as if had to re boot the mouse periodically it seemed to have nothing to do with recharging this would happen even after the mouse had been fully recharged it would be unpredictable as to when it would happen but overall even that was minor flaw but then one day actually the date of this writing march put the mouse receiver into different receptacle to use different tablet computer and it would not work no matter what tried to do then decided to take out the receiver from the usb receptacle and found that the metal square part on the receiver stuck into the usb receptacle so this leads me to believe that possibly the mouse receiver became faulty with regular use over few weeks since bought it otherwise the way that the receiver was made was not in the best possible way not rugged enough maybe however though don know at this point if this is the way that all these rechargeable mouses are this brand or if this particular one that bought just did not actually pass quality control at the factory it seems the company should give me replacement am going to see about it but guess will be told that the deadline for returns had been reached will update if am able to ,328,5.0

neutral,this mouse is great and if it didn do this one annoying thing would give it stars it emits really high pitched squeal when you don use mousepad it coincides with the led light color change if you pick it up and set it down it makes really high frequency sound that is very irritating if you work in quiet environment which do it similar to smoke alarm if it were far away get one that doesn have the lights that should help ,83,3.0

positive,i like this mouse the light colors constantly scroll through rainbow and aren static on just one color my office is in my bedroom and if leave the mouse on it makes great nightlight not too bright but just light enough to find my way around if wake up during the night especially love the fact that it rechargeable and that haven had to put any batteries in it since bought it several months ago the thing don like is that it has tendency to do its own thing sometimes if working on the couch and put the mouse down next to me flat and completely still not rolling backwards or moving at all the cursor on the screen will sometimes take off at diagonal stuttering its way up and across the screen at other times will be using the mouse to click and drag something or draw line and the cursor will suddenly jump to completely different part of the screen or it will hiccup and lose the hold on what was clicking and dragging or cause the line to wobble sometimes quite sharply kind of like trying to draw straight line in the car when the tire hits pothole it good little mouse and aside from the spastic glitches pleased with it but am getting tired of not having full control right when need it most may keep this one for its nightlight capabilities and shop for another rechargeable mouse to use with my computer ,247,1.0

negative, month update this thing squeals now it took me week to figure out why kept hearing high pitched whine every time moved my cursor and eventually realized that something inside the mouse is creating very high pitched squeal every time move it that on top of the mouse dying in about day of use now means that this thing is no go definitely buy something else this thing has been total headache since got it the battery on this mouse doesn seem to last very long time after about two days of usage it ll die find myself plugging it in every night to make sure don have to deal with that additionally the thing goes to sleep after about minute or two without movement super annoying you have to click the mouse to wake it up again and doing so registers click wherever your mouse was left on screen before it went to sleep can recommend it for any type of work that requires small periods of typing or reading you ll end up waking up the mouse from its weird sleep about million times ,186,1.0

neutral,the metal casing for the usb remote came off and is now stuck in the usb port of my computer,20,5.0
positive,first the left mouse click is not sensitive enough requiring longer press than usual for the mouse to register the click annoying and betting it will shorten the life of the mouse because you have to press harder longer another less significant annoyance make sure you don turn on the light feature it looks cool but the thing acts like lava light night light continually changing colors of light even when not in use even with the computer off which will run down the battery like the rechargeable feature but will be looking for another mouse ,96,5.0

neutral,goes through batteries like water,5,5.0
positive,is almost tiny for my hands and very light works so good and decently priced ll learn to use it for surfing the web yet let me mention it seems the curve under shape is fine for my thumb side but the pinky finger side is going to take some getting used to many times my pinky then fingers slide right under it or lift it off the surface slightly no matter how gentle think holding it in the past ve had taller models that have flair formed to keep the fingers in position in construction using stuff that requires good grip makes this like using feather barely feel makes me wonder how it would be for gaming if you got excitement and need to make lot fast moves elves would love this thing though and it scrolls and moves around so good may even make flange for my fingers and to give it some weight without an old fashioned battery weighing it down it is cool with the lights no joke good choice since many look just like this and perhaps everybody else has more grip control lol yet thank you found another fun product on amazon again ,199,1.0

neutral,clicking this mouse takes so much force have to physically move my arm to get the leverage to do it and if ever pick the mouse up off the pad my cursor moves erratically around even if it pointed at the ceiling literally the most important things for mouse pointing and clicking are useless on this thing looks nice though ,60,2.0
neutral,on my laptop it skips doesn read about of the time making it unusable for gaming or pretty much anything that requires quick response time tried it on several types of mouse pads and surfaces and it does the same no matter what ,43,5.0

neutral,not fan wouldn sync with one computer worked great with the other computer but it didn sleep when was done with it so the next day the battery was dead ll never remember to turn off the mouse when not using it so this is not going to be very useful ,51,3.0
positive,works great just feels little flimsy so not sure how it will hold up suppose it good value for the price the slowly changing colored led lights are pretty cool like that unlike the apple magic mouse you can use this mouse while it is charging the seller extended the warranty another months after registered it so that gives me little more confidence in the quality or at least the customer service was compensated by the seller for this review with refund of the purchase price of the mouse ,89,5.0
positive,the mouse is amazing you can pick out diff colors and love how it glows rainbow greatest purchase ever ,19,5.0

positive,i originally ordered the white version but when got it realized it was see through asked the shop owner whether this was just an issue with the version ordered or what all the white mouses look like they re all white according to the shop because raised concern they were so kind to ship different color to me free of charge didn even have to return the original ,68,5.0

positive,this came with an charging attachment but why this uses normal cell phone charger port and all the intuitions are in chinese theres random button at the top and when press it nothing happens and dont know how to tell how much charge there is on it other than that really like it so far its very sleek ,58,5.0

negative,the led lights are pretty but otherwise this mouse is not responding well and overall does not handle too well am disappointed and would not buy it again ,28,3.0
neutral,the wheel button feels like it requires the force to activate and makes the noise of the other buttons whoever approved this should be fired straight into the sun the wheel button gets more use in cad software than any other button and not even minutes of use and the wrist is already strained to the point where can not continue to work ,63,4.0
positive,i was skeptical at first that such small ergonomic mouse would work pleasantly surprised and have really enjoyed using it forgot to recharge it but it lets you know before it goes out by slowing down or moving from one screen to my other got it plugged in immediately and it kept right on working while it charged highly recommend this mouse and plan on buying another to have as backup for when forget to charge really love the color changing sequence the colors are bright but not overly so just enough to make it fun ,96,5.0
neutral,i use this with my macbook pro and its good eye catcher when djing ,14,5.0
positive,this mouse is very quiet just as advertised was shocked at the lack of clicking when you push the right or left side that was my main push to purchase besides the cool colors and led lights must say those are just an aestetic bonus but it kind of makes working fun this mouse is plastic so the gold tone you see is gold plastic and the underbelly is white plastic it charges fast and it responds just as quickly as my older battery powered wireless mouse overall this mouse is really great am glad bought it and if you are sitting on the fence just go ahead and get it ,111,4.0

positive,works great and looks classy ,5,5.0
positive,it cute guess it is pretty cheaply made you can just tell by the feel of it got the matte black one it charges pretty fast and lasts for hours on one charge love the nano usb plug it came with cord but just use my phone charger it does change colors and also has the option of turning the colors off with the little button on the bottom the instructions are all in chinese but using it is pretty easy the nano fits in little spot under the mouse for storage and also comes with an adapter it is quite flat so not the best for long term use like with gaming ll keep it but wouldn purchase it again for the price update have used this cheap little mouse for hours every night since got it ve only had to charge it maybe once week the charge is phenomenal still works perfectly ,154,2.0
positive,i wanted wireless mouse and this one fit my needs it is rechargeable and can be turned off which helps save battery power it can also be used while the charging cable is plugged in if necessary the colors are great touch and use them depending on the mood in at the time also like being able to choose the resolution on the fly with the button on the top have already recommended it to couple of friends ,78,4.0

positive,this mouse is amazing work in it and have been working from home for quite some time there are days where have to work hours my hand does not get tired at all when using this mouse for long periods of time it is super easy to setup just connect to the usb and you re done the best part that love about this mouse is that it is superrrrrrrrrr quiet the weeks that on call do not have to feel discouraged and walking on eggshells when have to respond to an urgent matter in the middle of the night and having to risk waking up my partner with the continuous mouse clicking sound will definitely buy another one just in case if lose it ,125,1.0

neutral,pros matte feel slim profile quiet clickcons instructions were in another language so there wasn any information on how to set up guessed came with scratch on it track wheel does not work ,33,5.0
positive,there nothing majorly egregiously wrong with this mouse but it doesn necessarily excel at anything the mouse is pretty light the buttons are reasonably clicky and responsive the sleep mode is bit aggressive and find myself often annoyed with how quickly the mouse goes to sleep and have to wait for it to reconnect before using it again the dpi is by far the biggest problem it doesn feel like the dpi switch on the mouse actually does anything and it almost feels like the dpi changes randomly while in use ve noticed this behavior with mouse mat and on flat desk alone this may be just my unit but beware it nonetheless overall it definitely good enough for what needed cheap wireless rechargeable mouse that is passable for office work however wouldn use it for anything beyond that ,139,1.0
positive,sweet sleek mouse with nice color can wait till its nighttime to show it off,15,5.0

positive,i bought it for work it so smooth color is matte black led lights are so cool and fun doesn make any clicking sound is rechargeable very happy with this purchase ,31,1.0
positive,if you get white mouse be prepared that you could get one that actually looks solid like it should or transparent like the one got guess sure it pretty interesting that instead of only the perimeter of the mouse lighting up the entire thing does but at the same time it takes the focus away from the design for the rgb it makes the mouse look cheap being able to see the skeleton of the plastic interior it even feels like mouse it only doubled the price tag bc of obvious to see rgb leds would ve liked it more if the leds at least blended colors but with an obvious wall of plastic in the way they don even do that despite its looks the mouse worked great for couple days the movement felt smooth the clicking felt good and it was quiet noticed the red laser id not shielded at all also the rgb lights stay on even when the mouse falls asleep and unfortunately after few days noticed the movement isn very good it may be okay for normal use but it not acceptable for gaming thought it was because of the low battery power but even at full power and changing the dpi around the issue remains this is gonna have to be returned ,218,5.0
positive,this mouse is awesome its sleek and it works so well it also looks great ,15,5.0
positive,i purchased one of these before and it was really nice like the way it looks and feels it pretty accurate and has good sensitivity and this one got card in it that said get this one for free don know how cuz can read chinese and the instructions are in chinese ,52,1.0
positive, like it easy to use and carry around if needed the box comes with nice short charging cord and usb usb adapter for use with either the bluetooth receiver or the charging cord nice addition that come in handy don like how long it takes for it to wake up though not sure what the time frame is on when it goes to sleep but if reading something or just have my computer on for video or music just turn the mouse off all together it quicker to just flick it back on than it is to jiggle it around to wake it rainbow colors are fun holds charge for long time can work pretty much the whole week before noticing its lagging and probably could use charge this makes it lot friendlier to use over batteries ll take the sluggish sleep mode over the clunky mouse styles with repeat battery replacements good find for the money ,157,1.0

positive,i believe this is great purchase the size is not too small and not too large its shape is thin but comfortable the lighting is glamorous do use it on my laptop at home about week because of this shut the mouse off to save on the charge but have to say that the charge does hold for long time if you forget cord is provided and it measures about long which is perfect to plug in and continue to use the mouse as you work the price is reasonable and worth it would like to purchase another for work but fear that its projected beauty may peek someone interest ,110,5.0

positive,i love the ease of use with this mouse the ability to charge it rather than constantly replace batteries and to shut off or put to sleep the noise it durable and perfect for my usage and was able to get it in pink ,44,5.0
positive,this thing works well most of the time if you don turn it off and just let it go to sleep mode it dies fairly quickly but you still get couple of days of use out of it if you re not using it hours day at least if you turn it off every time you re done though you can get probably month but at least weeks out of it with moderate use originally bought it to use with my ipad however the case on my ipad wouldn really allow the usb to plug into the charger port wish they made an option to get either usb or usb plug as you get both with this mouse but you have to plug the usb into the usb adapter which makes the usb plug significantly thicker than necessary now use it for my macbook just warning if you want it to scroll like regular mouse you have to change it in the setting of the computer but that macbook problem not problem with this mouse not all of apple setting decisions make sense but that nothing new do really like that can chose to just turn on the mouse with solid red color which preserves battery or turn it on to change colors reduces how much time you get out of the mouse but is cool feature my only complaint is that sometimes the mouse isn tracking perfectly and the cursor is in completely different place than would expect it to be further behind where was moving it to rather than the cursor doing its own thing but that may also be thing have to change on the laptop ,279,5.0
neutral,does not work,3,1.0
neutral,it very cute looks chic now can find my mouse at night with out problem ,15,2.0
positive,i ve been using logitech marble mice for years maybe over decade just love that you control the cursor with just your fingertips but it weakness is that the marble mouse scrolling function is clumsy and jerky as it lacks legit scroll wheel that is probably the sole reason bought this led wireless mouse the led mouse seems to function well it has sleep mode that easily wakes up and had pretty color light around it don use it for general mousing but for scrolling once get the cursor in the right window the mouse can be on the desk in my lap wherever it makes up for what don have with my marble mouse the price was right and think if it what paid for it it good cheap addition ,131,1.0

positive,great mouse use it for everything from gaming to normal use recommend it,13,4.0
positive,this mouse is extremely lightweight and easy to use love the lights that constantly change while you re using it the best part for me is the fact that it rechargeable just plug it into any usb plug it into my laptop at the end of the day battery usually lasts me few full days of work sleep mode is great and helps prolong battery life ,66,5.0

positive,i bought the white one and at first it was only lighting up red and thought the picture was misleading then realized the on off switch on the bottom actually serves two functions one click on will turn the mouse on and glowing red two clicks on and the rainbow colors appear will say the white mouse is almost translucent the rainbow colors illuminate the whole mouse not just the sides it plug and play very easy to use and comfortable ,81,2.0
neutral,this is probably my second review in life because hate leaving them but very disappointed that the scroll wheel stopped working right after month of use don even use it every day hell don even use it every other day so this definite came as shock of course the return window is closed which go figure when you sell cheap mouse and the seller isn easily accessible like to think out of good character and business that would be able to replace this mouse as love the color and the lights on it but what the point if it no longer serves its purpose ,104,3.0

neutral,i made the mistake of reading the reviews only after bought the mouse because it had stars with something like reviews so thought it was fine saw few reviews that said the seller tried to bribe them into removing their review that made me really regret buying from such an unethical business don think you should buy this mouse even if you re on budget there much better quality mice out there for even less money than this costs this mouse is very cheaply made as for performance issues for one it way too thin and lightweight when using it it very easy to knock it out of place and click something by mistake because it not heavy enough or grippy enough on the bottom to stay where you put it ve never had this issue with mouse before the tracking sensor is also way too sensitive the cursor still moves when you lift the mouse decent couple centimeters above the surface it on this also makes it very hard to put the cursor where you want it on the screen because it still tracking movement when you lift it up the cord to charge it is pretty short although that not huge issue just sort of disappointing the biggest issue is that the cord does not seem to fit properly into the port on the mouse and takes bit of manhandling it felt like was going to break some of the cheap thin plastic when first plugged it in as for looks the edges where the paint or whatever it is on the top are pretty rough and it even came with some of the paint chipped off bought the light pink mouse it not nearly as light as it is in the pictures it darker and much warmer toned rather than cool light pink like the picture it also not as reflective as the pictures show but that not huge deal you can turn off the rgb lights by the switch on the bottom if you want but it still emits red light when using it wish it didn do that it ugly and probably wastes more power ,360,2.0

positive,when first got the item the color looked off ordered the blue but fairly positive based on the images was sent mint green liked the quiet button clicks and it was nice to have in college classes for bit because it was so quiet however after only week and half the mouse wheel stopped working could feel the tension in the wheel was gone so opened it to investigate and it looked like there was small plastic rod that rotated with the wheel but the contact point between the rod and wheel was broken so it wouldn work anymore liked the aesthetics of it except for the red led used for the tracking would also overpower the rgb lights it bothered me but that didn affect the function wish this had worked better ,133,4.0

positive,worked good for the first months used the mouse on security camera hard drive to review camera footage worked fine one time and after that no cursor icon appeared tried plugging it back into my desktop and still no cursor icon available it won select anything only right click works but can scroll to selection luckily my desktop is touch screen so manually opened up the drives properties and it said that all device functions are working properly clearly not being able to see cursor is an issue ,88,1.0

positive,this mouse works as advertised the changing lights on the side of it are what drew me in when browsing for new mouse on amazon don really like the slim feel to it feel like my hand would get tired after using it for extended periods of time also was looking for specifically usb mouse and to make this one work with usb you have to use the included adapter which ends up sticking out quite ways on the edge of your computer this is clearly stated in the advertisement just didn pay enough attention when bought the mouse ,99,1.0
positive,the price of this mouse was cheap and you will get just that with this product it serves its purpose ok like the color changing led lights but this mouse is too lightweight for my liking and my hand is too big to fit on the mouse comfortably it feels like there is lag when moving the arrow just an overall not great feel compared to my mouse on my work office computer ,73,1.0

positive,i like that this mouse os sleek in design has long battery life and is easy to set up often forget to turn it off but that doesn matter because it goes into sleep mode to preserve battery the only concern my tablet has type so the converter is helpful the only thing that would change is that the converter doesn fit inside the mouse for storage so you have to be careful not to lose it if you detach it from the tablet ,84,1.0

positive,i knew what was getting myself into reading the bad reviews it stops working in few weeks usually hedge my bets especially when product has so many reviews that end up with star rating alas lost this bet the scroll function key feature look for in buying mice stopped responding after few weeks fluke should buy scratcher if so because bought two one white one black and they both failed around the same time wondering if this is actually engineered to perform this way though as seeing many other reviews doing the same thing but people being bribed for star if replaced quite genius actually if you get angry customers to review it promotes product engagement but then the rating can be manipulated by replacing the cheap product and soliciting star review if this indeed is the case bravo brilliant way to get as many positive reviews for subpar product ,150,2.0

positive,i needed mouse for my laptop and so bought this the set up was really easy simply charge the mouse plug in the usb and done the silent clicks are indeed quiet but wouldn say they re completely inaudible but that totally okay with me when the mouse charges it turns blue and when it done charging the light will switch off when turn on the mouse to the color mode the colors fade nicely to the next the only nitpick for me is that wish the white part of the top of the mouse was more opaque so that the backlit colors don peek through it but it personal preference also like how it came with usb to usbc adapter just in case it needs to be used for mac overall great mouse ,134,1.0

positive, needed new cheap mouse and this was on sale and read through lot of reviews saw lot of reviews stating that there was chance that the white version could potentially not be solid white allowing for the lights to show through the mouse through the top well that sounded cool to me so ordered white hoping that mine would also do the same pleased to report that it does so be warned that ordering the white version has chance to do this and apparently often find it fun though also happy to note that there is an inactivity timer on the mouse so when not in use it will conserve it battery power by turning off clicking with the mouse will turn it back on battery life has been good so far too work from home for hrs day and it survives my work day easily just plug it up to charge after work ,154,1.0
negative,i only used it once until it was dead and then charged for hours it wouldn even turn on have tried keeping it plugged in restarting my computer and trying the mouse on different computer and it still doesn work and now of course it passed the time to return or get refund even though it cute mouse it doesn work and frustrated ,63,1.0
negative,i purchased this little over months ago but used it only on the weekends on my personal laptop so not much usage on gaming or extensive clicking immediately noticed the charge does not hold up for less than than weekend days so started turning it off about months later noticed lagging in click response soon after clicks were not engaging replaced it with brand name you get what you pay for but thought should contact the manufacturer and ask for refund or replacement it been over weeks now and no response do not recommend this product or its manufacturer beware ,100,1.0
neutral,used it only for the past months and it doesnt work anymore ,12,1.0

neutral,i bought this mouse thinking it would be good mouse for my mac when opened it it took many attempts to connect and then it kept draining all of its battery every night do not buy this mouse its quality is very cheap overall bad purchase will be returning this,50,1.0

positive,my boyfriend got me this as gift to help with my crafting love this color because it goes with my cricut also loved that it came with an adapter for my macbook air these newer macbooks require adapters for anything that is not charging port or the newer charging cords so seeing it come with an adapter is amazing don have to carry around my other adapter and its very easy to use love it thank you so much for thinking of us apple users ,85,3.0
positive,great mouse for the price nice and soft matte feel very quite clicks perfect for working in coffee shop works well on mouse pads and flat surfaces and connected to my computer instantly without needing to instal any type of software note rgb lights are not customizable but still cute as heck and works great ,55,1.0
positive,the pros decent mouse for what needed like that it is rechargeable via usb port and can be used as both wireless and wired when plugged in and recharging the cons these first two are mostly preferences so take them however you wish it sits fairly flat so there isn much arch of your hand to rest on depending on what you are used to in mouse this just makes it slightly less comfortable to use based on my personal preferences secondly it has silent soft click normally when you click mouse you feel and hear the click of the button this feels more like am pressing on touch screen there is no satisfying click nor is there sudden give in the button rather it feels like poking couch cushion this could be what you want in mouse so do with this info what you will this last con is not based on preferences however found that occasionally my cursor will studder step to the left when am moving the mouse to the right with the dual screens have this means that end up with my cursor all the way over on the other end of my work space when trying to get to the right to close tab or select tool in my adobe programs it nothing that has caused too many problems as it only happen every once in awhile but it was enough to stand out and earn it place in this review ,246,5.0
positive, months into using this mouse it can stay charged and can barely track it works okay still doesn track well when plugged in but wanted cordless mouse for reason definitely don recommend this one ,34,1.0

positive,it lights up very pretty but is very laggy doesn track very good with cursor can deal with that since use mine for work so switched back to the mouse my company sent me ,34,5.0
positive,if you want cheap light up mouse then get this one when it on sale definitely not worth the price otherwise it very quiet and slim but that about where the benefits outweigh the cost the actual lighting is not what advertised it actually pretty dim even in dark room beyond that whenever you move the mouse the red laser at the bottom for tracking movement lights up the whole mouse taking over the other colors being displayed additionally with the hour charge time and the usb needed for connectivity you be better off buying nicer mouse for the same price,101,1.0
positive,it is pretty color and works great highly recommend this product ,11,5.0

neutral,my first impression of this mouse was that the design was not well thought out because ordered the mouse in white the inner workings of the lights can be seen through the top of the mouse every time you move it and you can turn off the red light because the white plastic is translucent however ignored this issue because it was purely an aesthetic problem and didn mess with the functionality of the mouse unfortunately week or so later the mouse wheel completely stopped working ve since then gotten new mouse for even cheaper and not only does it look better but it also feels better and holds up well don waste your money,115,1.0

positive,love it would recommend works great love that it light and can hear when you click the mouse lights are very cute,22,1.0
neutral,small lightweight yet firm solid feel led lighting is nice touch shuts off automatically once laptop or pc is shutdown however the main reason purchased was because of the silent feature sadly it not as silent as had hoped clicks are still audible especially on scroll wheel which is disappointing why cant someone make truly silent mouse have yet to find one as most silent mice are merely muffled by rubber lining shame would be perfect otherwise,77,1.0

neutral,when received this product the first time it had come broken the entire click pad was nearly separated from the base and couldn easily be snapped back into place sent in for replacement and everything was all fine they sent replacement no problems this was in april flash forward to december mere eight months the mechanism that holds the scroll wheel somehow snapped apart and the scroll wheel is now useless which makes playing games bit difficult as many games use the scroll wheel when to contact customer service all contact is closed use caution when ordering this mouse at first the replacement had been sent was good despite it not exactly having any sort of indicator as to when the mouse needed to be charged but if the scroll wheel mechanisms are gonna snap easily under potentially hard gaming sessions perhaps pass for something more heavy duty ,148,1.0

neutral,i needed wireless mouse for my new macbook pro that only has usb connections this mouse included an adapter that allowed the standard usb bluetooth receiver to be used in the usb port have only had an opportunity to use it in limited situations thus far but it seems very responsive and performed well the led lights are kinda cool but not really needed trying to see if there is way to use the mouse without the led lights on so can conserve the charge on the battery the only concern issue ve had thus far is that the charging cable connection to the mouse and the adapter don seem to be the most secure and couple times it seemed like the connection came loose and the mouse was no longer charging was still using my laptop while the mouse was charging via the usb port as recommended in the user manual the user manual specifically recommends not using plug in charging adapter like for most cell phones because it might overcharge the mouse and damage it it is recommended that you only use the provided cable and charge it via your laptop to avoid overcharging and damaging the mouse not certain how great an option this is since it seems to come loose and stop charging occasionally if continue to use my laptop while trying to charge the mouse we ll see how it goes in the future if it turns out that it was operator error may update my rating overall though the mouse feels good in my hand and it seems to work well doing everything necessary when need it ,273,1.0

neutral,i will quickly touch on the star ranking then get into it ergonomics feels good in my hand at first but after few minutes you start to realize something is off it little too small for extended use but hey that personal preference for the couple hours did use this thing the sleep mode worked did zero gaming with it because the basic task of trying to pull up netflix and hulu was nightmare the quiet click is top notch give that outta so ve had glitchy mice before and it was annoying but could deal with it for little bit they might twitch little or maybe vibrate some when the mouse wasn being used but this thing full jumps across the screen and not even in the right direction always use split screen and open netflix on the left screen and it pops up open on the right when move the mouse to the right it starts to move then jumps and ends up all the way back to the left it also lags every once in while and sometimes you put the mouse over something leave it there for second to make sure you are on what you want to click on and when you click it actually clicks on rows above where was this was on netflix this is nightmare of mouse do not buy its cheap mouse but not even the cheapest option you can buy cheaper mouse that functions properly the led lights did work just fine for me the next morning went back to using my mouse that is duct taped together until can get another one ,273,1.0

neutral,broke after one month went to plug it in and the charging port pushed way back inside the mouse and when opened the mouse up to fix it the piece had busted off completely ,34,5.0
positive, in all honesty there is very little practical value added by colorful light changes for mouse but you know what in this time of the pandemic we can all use bit of quirky and interesting little patches of fun and joy especially visually this little mouse got the gold color because it was the least expensive at the time always brings smile btw it is quiet no noisy clicks the color is beautiful and classic and the feel is very ergonomic and no stress on the hand and fingers if you re still on the fence get one or more if you want to give yourself little and very useful treat ,111,3.0

positive,i was used to buying name brand mouses and was worried about the size of this device but actually its good size just with lower profile works very well and sleeps and wakes up when you push the button on top the lighting is nice not real bright but just strip around the outside and the button lights up changes color which is nice touch so actually like it better than the other larger mouses have ,76,1.0
positive,you get what you pay for if you just need quick mouse on the go so you don need touch pad this is great enduring use of everyday mouse spend the money for one that is lightweight ventilated ergonomic or combination this one soft clicks decent feedback good battery just not super high quality for the desk job,58,1.0

negative,bought the rose gold one to match my laptop and while it not perfect match it still very pretty and love the lights it is very silent when clicking and very responsive when moving the mouse update so received this mouse exactly days ago and the scroll button is broke went to try to take it apart to fix it and even with the correct size screwdriver very small btw it just stripped the screw because it was so tightly screwed in so not only did my brand new less than week old mouse break they made it impossible to fix it by making fort nox screw not happy save your money ,112,1.0

neutral,this mouse is very cheaply made and did not function properly right out of the box it will move the cursor around and scroll but it will not click on anything right or left click ridiculous want to return it but the hassle of dealing with it isn worth getting the money back since it was so cheap to begin with should have known to go for more expensive and reputable brand like logitech ,74,4.0

negative,i have purchased this mouse twice and each time it has phased out on me after about months of use it stopped holding charge and cold only use it while it was plugged in which defeats the meaning of wireless then it completely went out on me and can no longer use the mouse at all even when it is on the charging cable have gone through the customer reviews looking for fixes and nothing update now being offered money to remove my comment no will not can care less about my money back want what paid for and refund shouldn be contigent upon removing my comment again don buy ,110,1.0

positive,for the money this mouse is great value needed new mouse as the click on my old brand name mouse was begging to miss wanted something fairly inexpensive wireless and rechargeable am tired of having to switch out batteries this mouse fit all those perfectly my first month impression is it excellent after the initial charge it still going strong with maybe an hour day usage after weeks it goes to sleep after period of inactivity which helps to conserve the battery my only gripe would be the slim profile think prefer little more bulk in my palm my only contact with the mouse when navigating is with my fingers no palm contact this does not deduct from my rating as it is clearly advertised as slim profile design all in am glad purchased this mouse if this company develops full contoured model would surely upgrade ,146,1.0

neutral,i wish the charger was longer it so short used it once and the mouse was not calibrated had to bang it couple of times then it worked buying new one do not recommend this product ,36,5.0
positive,this mouse looked promising based on all the positive reviews it is light good to hold and has good battery life it is also quiet with exceptions see below its main problem however is that the middle button the scrollwheel becomes unusable after only short amount of use after which the button needs to be pressed repeatedly in order to register button press also compared to the lmb rmb buttons which are sometimes too light and register button presses accidentally the mmb is extremely rigid in comparison it is also very noisy which is ironic as the other two buttons are completely silent it is much more noisy than other mice have used which is about as someone who relies on this button during daily usage this is very frustrating and frankly serious design flaw like to emphasize that the mouse has been treated well not rough also bought the non led version of this mouse and the exact same problem appeared after the same amount of time another drawback is that the mouse does not indicate when the battery is low leaving one to guess when to recharge it it often becomes erratic mouse pointer moves around and does not register movement well requiring power cycle this is occuring on more than one system all in all decent attempt but quite few issues need to be ironed out doubt the many positive reviews for this product have been based on any more than couple of weeks usage as these issues are consistent and appeared after months frankly expect mouse to last significantly longer and also have useable middle mouse button hope these issues get addressed by the manufacturer ,279,5.0
negative,update have been sent emails from the seller begging me to change my review of the emails offered me to do so this explains the positive reviews despite the terrible product the mouse freezes constantly left and right click will work but the mouse will not move this is the worst mouse ve ever had it also goes into sleep mode after minutes of not being used which is annoying and no way to turn it off the light also stays on while in sleep mode which doesn make sense the charge doesn last very long at all charging it every couple of days ,104,5.0
positive, just live my cordless keyboard and mouse they match my hp desktop computer perfectly ,14,5.0
positive,the good looks nice and feels good in your hand the bad the right click button is too sensitive constantly opening up the right click menu the pointer freezes and have to turn the mouse off and on to unfreeze it the ugly ordered silver mouse and got dark gray ,50,1.0
positive,so for anyone wondering charging it is easy if you plug it and the light in the middle is blue that means that it is not fully charged the blue light will turn off after being fully charged mine arrived on monday and on wednesday it turned off plugged it in and took around hours to charge it the light turned off the clicks are silent and is very comfortable to use one thing do not like is the scroller which can be little too hard tend to open many tabs at once at work and while am on pinterest lol but that just me overall is nice mouse and hope it can stay with me forever this is my th mouse in less than year ,126,1.0

positive, feels good in my hand and works well the roller wheel works as third button which is important for my work colors are pretty and you can turn the lights off so that bonus it charges so no batteries and loving that the only issue finding is that it goes to sleep very fast if you wait to long to move it you have to click the power like next to the roller wheel not big deal just annoying sometimes overall happy with it ,84,5.0

neutral,the device looks and feels good the left clicker is very sensitive and mandates that under normal use you keep your hand off of the top of the mouse on the left side or you will accidently left click the coloring is good looking but it is difficult to determine when you need to recharge the short charging cord connects to the computer so you must leave the computer on while recharging the mouse which is inconvenient but the control of the curser is good although occasionally it seems to jump to different place on the screen still not sure why that happens but it is decent value for the money once you teach yourself it quirks ,117,5.0

neutral,i really like the feel and look of this mouse love the matte feel and the lights its also very quiet and not clicky wasn expecting that for the price the only issue have is that if you use it with laptop and remove the receiver often the receiver will come apart im not techy enough to figure out how to make it stay together with glue idk whenever take it out the usb drive and the black part separate and its hard to take the drive out of my computer when that happens frustrating will say that it lasted couple months before that happened though if you use it with pc and never remove it itll last longer just wish could get replacement receiver don want to throw the mouse away if the receiver is the only issue with it got it in february and noticed that it glitches bit if its not on mouse pad or about to die which can be annoying but manageable the mouse charges very quickly ,172,5.0

negative,the metal piece that is attached to the chip on the ubs broke off in my side brand new laptop talking about being sick,24,5.0
positive,honestly feels bit on the cheap side and compared to other similar makes the main difference being led lighting so it adds wow factor to it clicking is also smooth and feels nice and the top down view is pleasing the lighting itself is mostly smooth but blotchy at some points where the color is abrupt rather than seamless transition performance wise it does the job but ergonomically doesn feel as form fitting as gaming mouse really use this as backup work mouse or home mouse where its just to surf the web also the cursor sometimes randomly jumps first time this has happened on mouse so it seems like they really cut costs and marked up the price if were to guess the price if seen the product without price tag probably say its about bucks ,137,5.0

neutral,the rose gold color is very pretty and the color changing effect was nice at first but after about an hour of use the colors started to glitch the back end of the mouse was staying yellow and the front continued to change colors there is an option to turn the colors off but you end up with red light that shows up randomly while moving the mouse around it will get the job done but also feels very cheap compared to logitech or name brand get what you pay for in this case ,94,5.0
neutral, like the color thought it was going to have changing colored lights it only close red which was disappointing it also kind of flat and smaller than expected overall mean does what need it to do ,36,1.0
positive,i recently bought new chromebook and wanted wireless mouse to match came across this mouse and after reading the reviews figured id give it try cant say how good it works yet because never recieved the usb adaptor with it and for some reason cant get it to connect wireless im sure ill figure it out but it wouldve been nice to have the wire option as well otherwise its slim which is what wanted and like the lights on it,81,5.0

positive,this mouse is great for what use it for like the rgb effects not really designed for gaming,18,5.0
neutral,this mouse has very poor sensor it will take several seconds to wake up after being inactive for bit and you sometimes have to click the dpi button or mouse buttons several times and shake the mouse for it to wake up the sensor also cannot move fast if try moving the mouse quickly the cursor gets very spastic and starts curving around the screen like deja vu is playing in the background speaking of clicks the left mouse button double clicks quite bit the only thing this mouse has going for it is its design even then the design is uncomfortable since its so flat find better mouse please don torture yourself with this ,115,5.0

neutral,every time use the mouse there is this high pitched noise hurts my ears,14,2.0
negative,i purchased for our office the mouse looked nice and the colors were pretty but mine started having problems just few days later it was unresponsive and jerky for few days then it stopped working despite charging overnight tried charging on different outlets to make sure the outlet wasn bad but it wouldn hold charge and died again within minutes when asked the other employee about his identical mouse different color he said his never seemed to work right and wouldn hold charge used the included cord and tried charging with the computer with hub with power strip and with charging block not included plugged into multiple outlets when returning packaged the items as requested and requested the pick up slip we found the return slip face down on the ground on the sidewalk several feet in front of our office few days later not stuck to the door or in the mailbox mounted next to our front door no one knocked to let us know it was delivered and we wouldn have found it if staff member hadn gone out to sanitize the outside door handles now we have to take it to drop off location because return pickup is going to cost despite the package being ready to send before the return sticker was dropped off am unhappy with both the item and the return and have already ordered similar replacements from another seller ,236,3.0
positive,this light up mouse is great and ve had few similar ones like that this one is rounded on the edges more aesthetically pleasing imo it holds charge for long enough that it not annoying though it would be nice if there was an option to turn the light off while using to save charge even more the options are just on constant red light or cycles through colors clicks are definitely as close to silent as you could get the only thing that is bothering me is that the wheel is squeaking after only weeks of use intend to drop some wd onto it and sure that will fix the problem but don think that should be necessary to begin with overall good choice though immediate update directing wd into the wheel well of the mouse is not easy even using pin dropped the mouse and now the wheel doesn scroll at all it just spins soooooo not great removing star either accept the squeaky wheel or be very careful when trying to oil said wheel because if you drop it it will die ugh,186,2.0

positive, wish would have seen the video from another reviewer with the white mouse before purchased the white one don like the fact that the light is visible throughout the whole mouse assumed it would just be line of light that circles the mouse as shown in the sellers pictures if you like the look of the whole mouse lighting up as shown in the video then this is the mouse for you overall do like the mouse and don want to deal with exchanging planned on getting the mint and should have gone with my instincts it glides smoothly and the clicks are slient won be returning it because do like it but just diappointed the white one was not as shown described,123,5.0

negative,i have been using for about weeks and it died it will not charge ,14,5.0
negative,a rechargeable cordless mouse is such good idea and invention you don have to deal with batteries and this mouse seemed not to need recharging for over day great this one bought worked well even though it did something odd and am not sure if it was the mouse or the inexpensive tablet computers that use or maybe the usb splitters that use however it was probably the mouse but after using the mouse normally for few hours the mouse would then not show the arrow on the screen and found that would have to turn off the swatch on the mouse and then turn it back on again it was as if had to re boot the mouse periodically it seemed to have nothing to do with recharging this would happen even after the mouse had been fully recharged it would be unpredictable as to when it would happen but overall even that was minor flaw but then one day actually the date of this writing march put the mouse receiver into different receptacle to use different tablet computer and it would not work no matter what tried to do then decided to take out the receiver from the usb receptacle and found that the metal square part on the receiver stuck into the usb receptacle so this leads me to believe that possibly the mouse receiver became faulty with regular use over few weeks since bought it otherwise the way that the receiver was made was not in the best possible way not rugged enough maybe however though don know at this point if this is the way that all these rechargeable mouses are this brand or if this particular one that bought just did not actually pass quality control at the factory it seems the company should give me replacement am going to see about it but guess will be told that the deadline for returns had been reached will update if am able to ,328,5.0
positive,the wife loves it we use it for the camera system,11,1.0
neutral,this mouse is great and if it didn do this one annoying thing would give it stars it emits really high pitched squeal when you don use mousepad it coincides with the led light color change if you pick it up and set it down it makes really high frequency sound that is very irritating if you work in quiet environment which do it similar to smoke alarm if it were far away get one that doesn have the lights that should help ,83,5.0
neutral,the only thing do not like is having to charge it with usb sometimes trying to use it and it dead so connect to computer and can use it works best with longer cord that don have ,37,4.0

positive,simply put it is great mouse for what it worth however had difficulty connecting the mouse to my macbook pro with the usb adapter that comes with the product have ports the manual grammar is terrible btw tells you to try different ports which they claim it will work normally in one of them none of them worked which was bummer then tried with my own adapter and it connected it right away the adapter they provide you is just useless so if you plan on getting this mouse to use with your macbook you should get separate adapter once connected it though it seemed to work perfectly smooth tracking silent clicks and the rgb lighting is beautiful just got it today so hopefully it will keep working the way they claim it should work ,135,3.0

positive,i love this mouse but hate it at the same time love it because it cute and it functions well that is if it doesn run out of battery charge during normal use the charge only lasts for about days it good that it can be recharged just didn think would be recharging it that often you can tell when it running low because it starts jumping all over the place just try to remember to charge it while charging my laptop also was under the impression that it came as usbc to charge and it does not it comes with an adapter for usb to usbc could ve just got an adapter for my old mouse had it been made clear ,122,5.0

positive,i like this mouse the light colors constantly scroll through rainbow and aren static on just one color my office is in my bedroom and if leave the mouse on it makes great nightlight not too bright but just light enough to find my way around if wake up during the night especially love the fact that it rechargeable and that haven had to put any batteries in it since bought it several months ago the thing don like is that it has tendency to do its own thing sometimes if working on the couch and put the mouse down next to me flat and completely still not rolling backwards or moving at all the cursor on the screen will sometimes take off at diagonal stuttering its way up and across the screen at other times will be using the mouse to click and drag something or draw line and the cursor will suddenly jump to completely different part of the screen or it will hiccup and lose the hold on what was clicking and dragging or cause the line to wobble sometimes quite sharply kind of like trying to draw straight line in the car when the tire hits pothole it good little mouse and aside from the spastic glitches pleased with it but am getting tired of not having full control right when need it most may keep this one for its nightlight capabilities and shop for another rechargeable mouse to use with my computer ,247,5.0

negative, month update this thing squeals now it took me week to figure out why kept hearing high pitched whine every time moved my cursor and eventually realized that something inside the mouse is creating very high pitched squeal every time move it that on top of the mouse dying in about day of use now means that this thing is no go definitely buy something else this thing has been total headache since got it the battery on this mouse doesn seem to last very long time after about two days of usage it ll die find myself plugging it in every night to make sure don have to deal with that additionally the thing goes to sleep after about minute or two without movement super annoying you have to click the mouse to wake it up again and doing so registers click wherever your mouse was left on screen before it went to sleep can recommend it for any type of work that requires small periods of typing or reading you ll end up waking up the mouse from its weird sleep about million times ,186,5.0

neutral,the metal casing for the usb remote came off and is now stuck in the usb port of my computer,20,5.0
positive,first the left mouse click is not sensitive enough requiring longer press than usual for the mouse to register the click annoying and betting it will shorten the life of the mouse because you have to press harder longer another less significant annoyance make sure you don turn on the light feature it looks cool but the thing acts like lava light night light continually changing colors of light even when not in use even with the computer off which will run down the battery like the rechargeable feature but will be looking for another mouse ,96,5.0

neutral,i have one and my grandson liked it so got him one for his birthday,15,5.0
negative,for you are better off getting wired mouse this thing is so bad the sensor light bleeds through the top shell of the mouse worse is that the actual functionality is very poor if your are looking for an accurate mouse this is not it have multi colored mouse pad and the sensor struggles between the change in shades making this mouse difficult to use if you have plain color mouse pad this may be acceptable but if your on the go this will not do ,86,2.0

neutral,clicking this mouse takes so much force have to physically move my arm to get the leverage to do it and if ever pick the mouse up off the pad my cursor moves erratically around even if it pointed at the ceiling literally the most important things for mouse pointing and clicking are useless on this thing looks nice though ,60,4.0

positive,this mouse is very quiet just as advertised was shocked at the lack of clicking when you push the right or left side that was my main push to purchase besides the cool colors and led lights must say those are just an aestetic bonus but it kind of makes working fun this mouse is plastic so the gold tone you see is gold plastic and the underbelly is white plastic it charges fast and it responds just as quickly as my older battery powered wireless mouse overall this mouse is really great am glad bought it and if you are sitting on the fence just go ahead and get it ,111,5.0

positive,there nothing majorly egregiously wrong with this mouse but it doesn necessarily excel at anything the mouse is pretty light the buttons are reasonably clicky and responsive the sleep mode is bit aggressive and find myself often annoyed with how quickly the mouse goes to sleep and have to wait for it to reconnect before using it again the dpi is by far the biggest problem it doesn feel like the dpi switch on the mouse actually does anything and it almost feels like the dpi changes randomly while in use ve noticed this behavior with mouse mat and on flat desk alone this may be just my unit but beware it nonetheless overall it definitely good enough for what needed cheap wireless rechargeable mouse that is passable for office work however wouldn use it for anything beyond that ,139,5.0

neutral,the wheel button feels like it requires the force to activate and makes the noise of the other buttons whoever approved this should be fired straight into the sun the wheel button gets more use in cad software than any other button and not even minutes of use and the wrist is already strained to the point where can not continue to work ,63,1.0

positive,i purchased this keyboard last year in november and have been very satisfied with it performance it is comfortable to type on and the different color backlighting is cool but it would be better if the sleep mode didn take effect so soon this is an issue when in dim room because it can be bit difficult to see the opaque lettering before pressing on that first key to activate the lights additionally recently the keyboard was only staying on if it was connected to the charging cable it came with and last week it began shutting off intermittently even while connected that should have alerted me to the fact that it was cable issue and not battery issue but it didn and contacted klim customer service lolita the customer service agent responded quickly and one of the suggestions given was to try different cable but she also reiterated that there was year warranty should none of the suggestions resolve the issue charging with different cable that already had in my possession worked and am now utilizing the keyboard again without having to be connected am extremely happy with this product and their customer service and would not hesitate to order one of their other products should need one in the future ,212,4.0

positive,i have had this keyboard for well over month now it is cordless and rechargeable the great thing about it is that when the battery needs charge can plug it in with the supplied usb cord and still use the keyboard while it is charging the keys are backlit with the light coming through each keys letter not just around them the lights turn off after short time of non use but light back up with the tap of any key would buy this again without hesitation if needed ,89,4.0
positive,i have been looking for wireless keyboard with back light and came across this one am really enjoying it no am not gamer am using this for work like the lights on the keyboard it really light weight and it does not take up lot of space the only issue is one of the shift key is loose but it not that bad to point where it needs to be returned for me that just my opinion the keyboard only lights up when it in use then after few minutes it goes into sleep mode and that not issue for me ,101,5.0
positive,seems to me that the left ctrl shift issue has been resolved can go into adobe illustrator and press ctrl shift and it will copy and paste in place for me that all really use it for lighting isn too bright but has nice ambiance to it no adjustment like their mouse their mouse as driver which can control more wish the keyboard had that keys had slim keyboard before and like playing on that little bit more keys are fairly quiet the keys are also taller so my fingers need to get used to it bit more bluetooth connectivity seems to be working good didn have any input lag,110,3.0

positive,i am not using the keyboard for gaming use it for everyday use of my personal computer love how it lights up so can see the keys without turning on the light in my office as an option the keys fell easy to press down on and it just feels comfortable to use after years also had an issue with one of the keys cracking and was very pleased that klim replaced the keyboard per their warranty thank you very much to them ,83,5.0

positive,love it,2,1.0
positive,ok the good small company like supporting that great packaging they have an insert that tells you about the team that designed the keyboard the construction is solid doesn feel like junk well made what could be better the brightness of the colors in the photo is not what you are going to see in the product you can see the colors but it not very bright this is simply light behind the keys but considering it connected to your computer it should be brighter because it has continuous power source what is jeez not good the key placement it off understand that anytime you get new keyboard that your fingers have to learn where the keys are but as large as this keyboard is it should be spaced just little bit better to standardized keyboard the return is way off am keeping it because it matches my mouse and it pretty know my fingers will eventually learn to reach yes reach for the return but right now it sorry just blows the product has potential to be super amazing and have no doubt they have production crew willing to get it there which is exactly why took the time to write an honest and detailed review ,207,1.0
negative,wanted to like this since it was cheaper for wireless keyboard with backlighting with in month or of normal use the letters and numbers wore off that could live with but then the one of the shift keys broke in half and made this unusable again this was with normal office use no gaming no smashing keys ,57,2.0
neutral,don walk run from this keyboard and company they say there is year warranty but there is not keyboard will stop working less than months from purchase,27,4.0
positive,looks pretty but not very responsive use it at work and have to back up and re read everything type as it misses letters adds extras if you even brush them with your finger which is the only time it works really well and spend way more time than should proof reading to make sure the keyboard isn making look like can type ,63,3.0
negative,bought this to get rid of wires on my desk and it has been great but the battery doesn last as long as expected and that with the backlights turned off was also disappointed to find that not all usb cables work to charge it lost the cable that comes with the keyboard to charge it and when it died only one of my usb cables would charge it and found that really strange not totally sure why that is but it something that noticed so if you don have lot of usb cables don lose the one that comes with it otherwise you might not be able to charge it otherwise like it haven had any problems other than what is mentioned ,123,2.0
negative,not for touch typing keyboarding backstory bought two of these one use in my classroom so when in the front of my room can type urls or hit the escape button love that it is back lit as often have lights off in my room during presentations or videos however bought second one for home and cannot type on it am old school and learned touch typing and do so at very fast pace but this keyboard has an extra key between the letter and the enter key therefore hit that key instead of the enter key every time very frustrating quickly returned it as it is useless to me ,110,1.0

neutral,i in the process of trying to find replacement keyboard for the logitech and this ain it either tried another keyboard before this one and it didn cut it at all the illumination on this klim is worse than the deluxe tried first with the brightness turned all the way up and the keyboard freshly charged it is very dim and hard to read especially all around the outside edge of the keys keyboard another minus is that every time you stop typing it turns off the illumination yes it does come back on when you start typing but when you can see which keys are which it hard to find the correct key to press without messing up your work it is also fairly small keyboard little bigger than the deluxe but not much once again the old adage you get what you pay for comes into play still looking ,151,5.0
neutral,works well,2,5.0
neutral,stopped working after few weeks ,5,1.0
positive,this product is perfect am just using it as regular keyboard for my laptop but my gaming buddy immediately picked it up and was checking it out he seemed impressed with it and that was enough to have me sold on it the lights are great the keys feel perfect for typing as far as spacing goes the wireless is nice touch as well excited for years of use to come from this thing ,74,5.0
positive,for the price of the keyboard the quality is outstanding great feel built well looks nice overall came in nice sleek package with stickers as do all their products all can say is get yourself one and check it out yourself now for gaming it does great but if your serious tournament status then obviously you ll need wired keyboard other than that any games you enjoy playing will do fine personally play gta rp and ve had no problems works flawlessly all my fps have no issues either can move around and keys work in sync just fine multiple keys at once works all around great have mouse as well and same thing if your hesitant due to to the pricing don be you ll be happy and glad you made the purchase was skeptical myself and wasn expecting the quality to be that great took the chance and am glad did ll be purchasing more of their products moving forward ,162,2.0
negative,this keyboard is worthless it only lasted months before it started cutting in and out it takes me minutes to type one word because this keyboard cuts in and out it so frustrating trying to use this junk keyboard don waste your money ,43,2.0
positive,i use this at work it great everyone asks me about my keyboard all the time have adhd and it actually helps me focus ,24,5.0
positive,i like the keyboard for all of its features except for one the enter key it difficult to touch type due to the weird shape of the key keep hitting the backslash key when really want to hit the enter key normally the backslash key would be located on the end and right above the enter key this won be problem for those who don touch type but for those of us who do it an impossible reach when trying to fly at words per minute for this reason don recommend this particular keyboard going to be looking for new keyboard ,101,5.0
negative,lights are very dim and cut off after seconds no way to change it this wouldn be problem per se but the letters on the keyboard are very dark white even with the lights in the room on they are hard to see until you press button to get the backlight on so if you use your keyboard in darkish room this is hard pass don have to look at my keyboard to type but if have let the backlight go out while think about something else and my hands leave the keyboard have to spend few seconds orientating my hands at the correct spot this is real pain also not as quiet as they make it sound ve had cheaper non name wired keyboards that were almost completely silent ,130,4.0
positive,first off this keyboard has been nice to type on considering the price at first the keys were bit too soft and required slightly more pressure to press but as typed more on it they loosened up and now feel great the keys feel clicky but soft enough where it not loud to type the space bar is bit louder but not as loud compared to other keyboards works great as an external keyboard for my windows and mac laptops do wish the max brightness of the keys was higher as it not as bright when the room light is on also it would be nice to have the option to change the colors of the lights like other keyboards that are around the same price range or cheaper lastly it would be slightly less annoying to have the option to use the media keys without needing to press the fn key for macs on my macbook pro with mojave was able to change the settings to where the ctrl key functions as the command key on mac you simply go to system preferences keyboard modifier keys and ensure that the correct keyboard is selected on the top next to select keyboard for me it was wireless receiver once the correct keyboard is selected changed the control key to command and changed the command key to control now the ctrl key functions as the command key however the windows key functions as the command key by default so these steps are not necessary if you re okay using the windows key overall would recommend it if you re on budget and don mind some of the drawbacks mentioned still great keyboard and battery life is pretty good ,287,4.0
neutral,carry it in backpack at work field applications days week it hard core certainly can take beating ,17,3.0
neutral,ordered specific bluetooth keyboard based on youtube review this one came up but didn show the name it looked like the one search but it cheap dongle only full sized keyboard misleading advertising ,33,1.0
neutral,while this keyboard is good it not silent like the description says also the shape of the enter key is awkward and don like it but that is from personal perspective on like dislike for the shape it by no means takes away from the effectiveness of the keyboard will be looking for another one similar to this one maybe even the same brand ,64,5.0

neutral,i like the feel of this keyboard the back lighting works well it solid keyboard the only reason didn give it stars is the back slash key is next to the enter key all my other keyboard have it above the enter key frequently hit the backslash when intending to press enter ll get use to it and would probably them give this stars after do ,66,3.0

positive,liked the size and curved screen easy on the eyes ,10,1.0
positive,if you just need wireless keyboard it is as decent as any other no complaints in terms of typing the back lit function however is very weak the brightest setting really does not brighten the key lettering so you can see in darkened room what you re typing the backlit is just very nice looking dressing that brightens under the keys and constantly shuts off so you have to click something then undo before can type with the fancy light on practical level the back light is really useless just nice to look at nothing more,96,4.0
neutral,i not pc gamer but spend lot of time on my personal pc during the day wanted something inexpensive with backlit keyboard and number pad and this fits the bill the keys do make an audible click so it not silent really like the value of this keyboard and the design ,51,5.0
negative,cheap product did not last long and wireless connectivity is horrible,11,5.0
positive,i ordered this keyboard few months ago and absolutely love it mainly use my keyboard for school and casual gaming it charges quickly and lasts very long time the connectivity was simple and consistent and the quality was just as good if not better than my boyfriends corsair keyboard that is nearly four times the price they keyboard itself has great feel to it the keys are not too loud and it does not have that cheap hollow plastic feeling like most budget gaming keyboards do what makes this product even better is the excellent company behind it few weeks ago my dongle stopped working highly likely it was user error commute with my laptop quite bit and tend to forget to remove my dongle reached out to their incredibly friendly customer service and after some troubleshooting and confirming it was not software problem they promised to send me out new dongle once they got back in stock week or two went by and just when thought maybe was out of luck received an email from lolita informing me that since their replacement dongles were still out of stock they would be shipping me brand new keyboard had the new keyboard at my doorstep in two days just in time for my online mid term in my experience most tech companies completely forget about their customers or blow them off when it comes to little things like this already loved my klim keyboard but we are now officially klim household highly recommend buying their products ,255,4.0
neutral,this keyboard was fine for larger hands than mine before buying notice the position of the enter key could not reach it with my pinkie without moving my hand away from the home position ,34,3.0
positive,excellent,1,5.0
positive,great keyboard for the price love the feel though somehow do feel it isn as hefty when typing than used to some people might like this light feel prefer heavier response when click work from home coder so use it on average minimum hours daily it lasted approx days on single charge not bad at all if you charge it overnight once week you shouldn have any problems with it dying randomly the auto sleep feature is nice to prolong the battery but when working it can be like off putting that the lights go out vs them constantly being on ,101,3.0
neutral,they moved the back slash and pipe command key down next to the key and made the enter key taller keep hitting the key instead of the enter key ,29,1.0
positive, this was pretty good buy and it actually better than thought it pretty quiet when typing and very smooth love how it goes to sleep mode after few seconds the lights on the keyboard are nice and vibrant much better than thought it would be comes with usb to cord for lightning fast charging only charged it once on friday and it still going we ll see how long the keyboard power will last will definitely keep you guys posted other than that no complaints so far ,87,1.0
negative,this keyboard is decent it types well has good tactile response and an easy to adjust to layout in addition the rgb backlight works great and looks good minor flaw the flip out legs to prop the keyboard to more ergonomic position tend to close easily from the pressure of typing or gaming minor flaw if you type all day and game all night this is not the keyboard for you since the battery life when subjected to all day activity is relatively short have to charge the keyboard literally five times as often as my wireless mouse of different brand major flaw given that battery life is not where would like it to be the biggest problem with this keyboard is that there is absolutely no warning that the battery on the keyboard is low you are typing or gaming and the keyboard suddenly becomes non responsive because the battery is suddenly dead of course quickly resolved by plugging in the charging cord but incredibly annoying and inconvenient overall decent keyboard but not having any type of warning that the battery is almost dead is really annoying since having to stop and plug it in often causes the loss of train of thought when working or the death of my avatar when gaming pretty lights though ,217,1.0
neutral,the worst keyboard iver ever had to use came from amazon wow im shocked ,14,1.0
neutral,then were kidding when they said this was quiet keyboard after using it for less than days the keyboard squeezes on several keys when push it including the space bar it is very annoying so plan on trashing it since it is past the return date purchased this keyboard because wanted light up keyboard use it for work too much noise ,61,1.0
positive,update after six months the keyboard has died won hold charge any more my whole experience with this thing has been negative and would strongly recommend against buying one even if it is cheaper than when bought it original review when gave it three stars bought this primarily because wanted wireless backlit keyboard and this one lights up well only it goes off after only about minute and leaves me in the dark you of course only have to punch key to bring the lights back but it still interrupts my whole process when working it has nice touch which was why bought gaming keyboard even though don play games and would otherwise like the keyboard but this feature leaves me contemplating buying different brand drives me crazy ,128,1.0
negative, tried everything contacted the support through the website and no response since feb th after the day got the item its the th rn of feb and so waited little longer for response but nothing and so tried to connect the cord to the item again nothing and the usb as you can see in the video is connect to my computer and tried connecting it to other ports in the computer but nothing else work also tried with the charging cable to see if that would work but nothing again so am disappointed in the product,97,5.0
negative,i picked this up because was looking for quiet wireless keyboard the reviews and product information said this was the one for me but it disappointing the keys are quiet but the space bar is so loud and rickety that it more than makes up for the quiet keys and since using this to type all day and not game the space bar gets hit lot ll deal with it and the other features of the keyboard are fine but this is disappointment to me ,85,1.0
neutral,home computer use not gaming ,5,1.0
positive,it great keyboard with great battery life well built and perfect for the casual gamer it hooked right up to my xbox ,22,5.0
positive,i kind of unsure how this has so many great reviews on my second in only months sometimes the keys randomly stop working or things like the scroll lock just randomly turn on when you have never touched it on mine the sicker where it tells you if the caps and num lock are activated is already starting to pull off again this is only after months do use it daily but that really shouldn matter also the space bar is super loud and inconsistent but if you are like me your would rather troubleshoot something instead of wasting something and just throwing it out tried contacting the company but that literally nonexistent amazon just kept giving me to the wrong site and there not number or email you go to contact them from amazon and they bring you to winter outerwear site those clearly aren the same companies would have loved some help instead of throwing this thing in the trash trying not to be wasteful here the battery will die randomly with no warning super inconvenient when you re just trying to work ,185,4.0
negative,this keyboard may look cool but that about it the keys are not button like like the one brand normally use so typing with average size nails is difficult it makes way too much noice for my comfort am returning the product because it doesn meet my expectations ,48,5.0
positive,i ordered this keyboard and used it for about weeks and then it just stops working would charge it for hours and it just won turn on it would turn on for like minutes and then immediately shuts off then emailed amazon and got replacement the replacement stopped working days in and it is the same issue it just somehow turns off and then would charge it and it just won stay on for more than mins returning both now and thats it ,83,5.0

neutral,you can beat it for the price,7,4.0
positive,love the keyboard everything about it it was great purchase ,10,5.0
positive,it great the only reason didn give stars is because the lights go off almost as soon as you stop typing understand that it has an energy saver to keep you from constantly recharging it but seconds would have been perfect you barely can enjoy the effects as far as being loud it not loud to me don what kind of silent vortex these other people need to be in but it quiet enough keyboard ,75,1.0
positive,control shift doesn work saw this in other older reviews but this was supposed to be new version of the keyboard so hoped it was fixed nope before all the other features backlighting ergonomics etc keyboard needs to allow you to press keys and have those keys go to the computer use this combo constantly for work to login to sites as different users or without cookies not taking what type and send it to the computer is non starter for me even if you don use this combo lot there might be other combos that don work and just out of principal don think it good idea to support product that doesn actually allow you to type something and have it go to the computer ,126,3.0
positive,i could afford way more expensive keyboard but honestly love this one,12,5.0
positive,the keys where not sensitive enough but overall it pretty good for gaming ,13,5.0

negative,i bought one for my grandson and he seemed to like it for gaming we had to return the first one for the same reason so that was two his second one is still working so we decided it must have been an isolated incident wanted the colored backlighting as well and it was still rated higher than most so purchased one for myself bad idea this morning it worked when signed in to my computer and then stopped working in the middle of meeting do not trust this product cannot even return the most recent one and do not understand why out of bucks ,105,5.0

positive,the attached picture is for review of the stickers the letter that had to buy for this keyboard if you look at the paint that outlines the key it wearing off other keys are wearing off too and once they wear off you can see the letters you just see globs of colored light what use is an illuminated keyboard if you can see the keys what more if you don touch the keyboard for seconds the illumination disappears and the keyboard is completely dark even when it plugged in the only way to wake it is to touch the keyboard again so now you have keystrokes on your screen in your document on your game etc that you didn want know keyboards wear out but ve only had this one for few months very shortly after submitted this review and after took the time to add all of the stickers to the keyboard it began to malfunction and add characters that wasn even typing gave up and retired it after about months update never contacted the seller about the keyboard when they saw the feedback they reached out to me and replaced the keyboard for free without having to return the defective product four stars because will have to see how the keyboard works out for me this time but must give klim technologies usa six stars for outstanding customer service ,232,5.0

positive,it feels cheap compared to my corsair it is just average sorry but am spoiled the only thing it has going for it is that it is wireless which is why will keep and use it the keyboard seems to be smaller am touch typist and my fingers feel cramped think it impedes my typing speed pretty good at above wpm don use it for gaming write voraciously and need keyboard that has quick response this one is ummmmm just okay ,81,4.0
neutral,i don write reviews very often but will make an exception for this piece of junk were you wanting wireless keyboard because this is not wireless it requires usb cable for power oh yes indeedy and so now you are using not one but two of your usb ports for this bs what waste of time,56,3.0
positive,after using it for couple hours on its initial charge plugged it in using the given charging cable but it would never charge plugged it in to my computer the wall and with different usb charger and nothing worked cannot recommend anyone to purchase this product when it does not charge properly if it worked would have given it star review because it looks nice has rgb and had very little latency despite being wireless do not buy this product ,80,5.0

positive,here are few major issues bought this keyboard for main reasons it was supposed to be ergonomic silent lit up and good qualityergonomic this is not ergonomic it black ordinary keyboard with some lights silent keyboard this is not silent it is the loudest keyboard have had in years lights thought you could decide what lights shine through the keyboard nope you get to pick how bright it is and whether it solid breathing flickering or off the color pattern never changes the worst part is after seconds of not using the keyboard all of the lights turn off which is really problematic when it dark and you are relying on the lights to see they letters quality it feels like cheap plastic overall give this stars would not purchase it again ,132,4.0
neutral,so far so good although my first impression is that putting the on off switch underneath is stupid lights going off after minute is problematic in the dark unless you really know your touch typing fn pause lights high low or offif reviews are accurate now ll wait to see if got one that lasts ,55,1.0
positive,this is great keyboard except for the fact that the enter key is not wide enough the backslash key takes the place of where the first bit of the enter key should go will probably end up returning because don want to relearn how to type to make up for smaller enter key ,53,1.0
positive,bought this for family member and decided wanted one as well worked like cha for both of us also lo the way it sounds ,24,2.0
positive,i was little apprehensive about buying this keyboard at first because didn want anything shaped too gamey or angular guess you could say but was too impatient to wait another hours for different style to ship out so jumped on this one and don even notice the shape anymore at all love this keyboard the keys are not completely silent but almost the perfect amount of soft clickiness just enough to let you know you ve hit key the colors are vibrant and so fun even in broad daylight so far battery life is great love that you can charge and still use it at the same time some won allow this the only thing ll have to get used to is the enter return key is about an inch farther to the right than used to but that matters less to me every day very happy ,147,4.0

positive,i bought this keyboard because it was one of the cheaper ones with decent reviews and have to admit for the first month or so it was great but now it doesn connect well wirelessly and it hassle to try and get it to register the keys pressing which is frustrating when first got it there were no issues and it was comfortable enough to use like most standard keyboards and the rgbs are nice but the sleep mode gets tad bit annoying after while ,85,5.0
neutral,i had this keyboard for months and recently as other reviewers have mentioned the bluetooth receiver fell apart it was kind of loose in the usb port for while but managed to leave it alone however packing and unpacking my laptop more than usual on business trip jiggled it enough that it came out except the shell of the receiver is still stuck in the port will have to take it somewhere to have professional use pliers and whatever to unstick that without damaging the laptop as would likely do on my own while it was working the keyboard performed fine only had to plug it in to charge it few times since it didn even last year because one of the most essential elements was made with shoddy materials have to give stars though ,135,4.0

neutral,wouldn even mind the fact that have to keep it plugged in of the time if it actually stayed plugged in ,21,3.0
positive,i bought this keyboard about year ago and have used it extensively with no issues whatsoever up until recently when the bluetooth dongle stopped responding contacted klim customer service to request new dongle because the keyboard itself was in perfect working condition they told me that they were in the process of moving warehouses and it would be faster to send me new keyboard they shipped an entirely new keyboard within few days am beyond astounded at how fantastic their customer service is did not ask for new keyboard yet they offered one just to make me satisfied customer plan on using klim products from hereon in whenever need tech that they sell highly recommend this company and applaud how excellent their customer service is ,125,3.0

neutral,i was attracted to this keyboard due mainly to the colorful lighting but after couple of days of use just couldn handle the noise the spacebar made if you use the spacebar lot for gaming you may become distracted and irritated think liked the idea of this keyboard better than the keyboard itself ,53,1.0

neutral,finally got it to connect and it doesn register most keystrokes there website doesn have driver to download unsure how to resolve this problem this is paper weight at the moment ,31,1.0
negative,i am very much casual gamer but even so would not recommend this keyboard to anyone latency is awful keystrokes are either missed or repeated which means wouldn even use this for office applications yeah it is cheap guess except that you might as well set your on fire why not save little more and get something of quality that will actually hold up to the task for which you bought it also you know it mediocre junk when amazon does not even want it sent back as return ,89,2.0
neutral,took it out of the box set it up minutes later it stopped working completely ,15,2.0

positive,i love this keyboard so much that bought two love the backlit lights especially if you like to play games or just use in general in the dark or very low light and not bad for its price ,38,1.0
positive,wanted this for living room computer put the wifi reciever into usb port in back of the pc by my tv and if use the charging cable that came with it got further away than using the wifi component it seems which means you get between ft of range for anything other than using it across room it does seem responsive easy to use and other wise great keyboard but if you want to sit more than ft from your computer you may want something else ,86,1.0
neutral,good colors fast shipping,4,4.0
positive,the cool features for gaming notwithstanding multi colored back light keys that can breathe or rotate this is an excellent all around multi function keyboard for general pc workload including function buttons that allow dimming brightness volume control etc keys are responsive and charge lasts about hours of gaming depending on usage and how bright the settings of the back lighting for the keys are set plus the customer service at klim is top notch highly recommended you will not be disappointed ,82,5.0
positive,this company deserves stars for their incredibly prompt and wonderful customer service this company truly stands by their product my klim keyboard stopped working after about years since they had year warranty reached out and they quickly responded they asked me to shipped the defective keyboard back to them they would refund the shipping cost and they would also send me new replacement keyboard in the meantime however realized really don care for this keyboard layout don use this keyboard for gaming it primarily for work so the short enter key was irritating at times unlike standard keyboard this one has three keys in between the and enter keys rather than just two keys like typical keyboards so declined their replacement offer didn want to go through the shipping hassel for replacement that don care for was just going to cut my loss look for something else and thought that was the end of it however they immediately offered me full refund or the option to try the upgraded version that has the standard layout the light opted for the latter the keys in the upgraded version are very quiet and feels bit mushy but it works great and highly recommend this company you can definitely purchase with confidence they really do stand behind their warranty and the level of customer service they provided was top notch they were extremely caring easy quick and hassel free ,236,1.0
positive,this is great and affordable keyboard great response time feels great to type on useful in the dark and long lasting battery ,22,1.0
neutral,very cheap for the price received the item and did not work some of the keys didnt work tired to return this item to amazon but it is non returnable item even if it is broken now am out dollars beware stay away from this product,46,5.0
positive,when in doubt always look at the most recent reviews rather than most popular really wanted to like this keyboard it started off fine but then the battery would hold its charge less and less within month of owning it it needed to be plugged into the usb charger all of the time or else it would immediately lose its charge and turn off so now have functionally wired keyboard after trying to buy wireless one speaking of function the numpad keys do not work and the usb charging cable is ridiculously short have to use an extension cord just to use it on my standing desk the usb cable must be special because none of the other usb cables own work with it macbook oculus jabra even cable that specifically said it would work with this keyboard the rgb was one of the main reasons why bought this keyboard but it leaves lot to be desired it not that bright and isn dynamic when typing save your money unless you really want to spend for paper weight ,178,5.0
positive,at first glance the keyboard looks and feels nice the keys are decently silent though very loud compared to my other low profile minimalistic keyboard and the rgb is cool however there are several design flaws that make it very annoying to use the function key is on the right side of the spacebar which is non standard so very weird to use keyboard shortcuts like ctrl shift for dev tools in chrome am programmer only works on the right side of the keyboard not the left which used to and works on every other keyboard ve ever used and the issue cannot be fixed with the klim reset keyboard combo so you re stuck with the issue the rgb is somewhat faint and even on the static setting doesn stay on it dims after not very long at all of inactivity making me have to constantly type to keep it onoverall would save your money you could get much better keyboard for the same price that doesn have the glitches or annoyances honestly surprised this keyboard has so many good reviews and that klim continues to sell known defective product without offering returns what sham ,196,2.0
neutral,i purchased this keyboard in january and it worked great now it has stopped working reinstalled the drives and still nothing hope they will stand by their product and send me replacement ,32,5.0
negative,this is functional in the sense that it does have keys too bad it has minute battery life and you cannot use it while it charging absolute trash product tempted to just throw it away ,35,3.0
neutral,if you re programmer or generally use the ctrl shift key combo please skip this the left ctrl shift combination doesn work so you ll have to retrain yourself to use the right only apparently this is known and ongoing issue it not worth the time or effort ,48,3.0
positive,i am still working with it to review the mouse connection and other parts and then other features to it so far so good,24,4.0
neutral,the year warranty reeled me in unfortunately needed the key feature to work and neither the light indicator nor the key functions worked it also had initial charging issues it took days to charge then it was charging but not for very long hrs cs said the only option was to exchange so did the exchange charged right away but the key caps indicator didn work the key functions didn work either the cs on the exchange told me that could have just returned it the first time and not go through the exchange process that process turnaround time was couple of weeks lost spend more money and get better keyboard one with established reviews track record in this case year warranty was marketing only because the keyboard never performed at ,131,2.0

neutral,poorly built don order ,4,2.0
positive,the keyboard colors cannot be set to single color but the brightness can be dimmed or turned off the charge only lasts days the keys are very quiet feature was looking for gave stars due to the short battery life ,40,5.0
positive,well for starters you can beat the price of true wireless computer keyboard like most of the other reviews didn care for the battery life so after losing power one night and the battery had died in the keyboard looked over to my power bank and said to myself why not not only does it work can sit on the couch about feet or so from the tv and don need to worry about the keyboard battery life nor having super long charging cable knocks on wood so far the keyboard has been holding up and can say that it has paid for its self the only issue have with it is the enter button like to make emoji faces and every time go to make one always do instead other then that great budget friendly keyboard ,137,3.0
neutral,very cool keyboard works great but after couple of weeks after return window closed it will only work when plugged into power kinda defeats the point of having wireless keyboard ,30,1.0
positive,i have tryed many times to change the colors and they wont change but the battery last for good long time,21,5.0
positive,ok so there is nothing wrong with this keyboard but nowhere in the description did it say that it had matte finish the keys have slightly sandpaper feel to them that just cannot handle as highly sensory sensitive person every time touch key it is like nails on chalkboard it was great price so decided to use it as keyboard for my tv used very infrequently instead of my primary computer keyboard rather than return it am now shopping for an alternative primary keyboard to use ,86,4.0
negative,keyboard worked great for the longest time but ive had it for bit over year and now typing is progressively become more difficult due to the lost key presses its got bad enough to affect games now so my player stops and takes stuttering steps before returning back to normal for short while ,53,4.0
neutral,the keys start to fade and you can see the letters numbers after repeated use ,15,5.0
neutral,this keyboard has short battery life and doesn give any sort of indication that the battery is low till it stops working then when you charge it it doesn let you know when its done it also doesn seem to like any alt or windows key related shortcuts from the left side only the right,55,4.0
neutral,product is fine but it super limited to what it can do you are stuck with the rainbow colors for the lights which is not what the description sounds like so would say this is nearly false advertisement based off of wording but it probably translated through levels of google translate so who knows obviously is membrane keyboard and it very squishy the lighting isn bad and the only gamer thing about this is the rgb you can control would have rather had completely red one am going to find another keyboard and return this one for its lack of functionality ,101,4.0
positive,i had slight issue and was sent new keyboard with express shipping turned out the original keyboard worked after all great customer support ,23,5.0
positive,got this keyboard as replacement for previous wireless keyboard liked the multi colored backlight functionality however what do not like is that the lights turn off after about seconds of no use wanted this keyboard to stay lit up but it just doesn do that still works and functions like good keyboard just hoped that the lights would stay on longer ,61,1.0

positive,i really like this keyboard it great because it pretty and lightweight don like that the charger is so weird though it has tendency to get loose that the only thing found wrong though don leave the power on don think this has sleep mode you ll come back and this thing will be stone dead lol always shut this off when done with it ,65,1.0
positive,been looking for good first wireless keyboard that won break the bank and have been pretty satisfied ve used this keyboard for weeks and haven had any issues the keyboard itself is very lightweight as for gaming ve had no issues across multiple games great starter wireless keyboard for the price ,51,5.0
positive,ok tried everything in the world to get this keyboard to work plugged the dongal into the usb port charged it up overnight and finally restarted the computer looked at the bottom of the keyboard and saw nothing but there is very tiny button that blends in with the rest of the keyboard which is in the off position when it first arrives turn the button on this message is for people who haven had to buy new keyboard in million years like me hope it helps all the non techie people out there love the colors on the keyboard and because of my set up the keyboard is in fairly dark area in pull out beneath the desk so this is really really helpful very light to the touch as advertised not gamer but you don have to be to appreciate this keyboard ,144,4.0

neutral,buyer beware used the keyboard for almost year and it was pretty solid no complaints but recently went to charge the keyboard and the charging port started to smoke and burned the port and charging cable almost caused fire in the office ,42,5.0
neutral,i purchased this months ago for work at home really like everything about the keyboard accept the letter quality as you can see by my picture within months the letters have started to rub off it has the backlight but it doesn matter because it lights the key and not the letter so you don know which key it is unless you have them memorized next time would pay bit more for double shot laser etched ,76,4.0
positive,great for gaming and work from home very silent and waterproof accidentally tested but the rgb could improve more modes or disable the sleep mode could be great,28,5.0

neutral,it nice keyboard,3,5.0
positive,easy installation lights don say on the entire time only when keyboard is in use only down side is that it doesn come with an extended warranty so that is something they should work on only purchased this because my spacebar went out on my laptop yes could have brought it some where to have the whole keyboard replaced but why have those noisy techs all in the business and have to order it so all tge wait nope pass now have this dope keyboard that lights up and works great ,91,4.0

positive,i bought when started to play more mouse keyboard games and didn want to be tethered to the computer it pretty has nice height with the little feet but is little glitchy sometimes it might be that the charge is running out but it puts itself to sleep the lights turn off and the keys don register in bursts and have to switch back to my wired keyboard the only fix is to plug it into the computer with cord that is shorter than my existing wired keyboard cord ,89,1.0
neutral,this keyboards has decent design however it disconnects very often it completely useless if can use it ,17,4.0
positive,this keyboard works exactly as expected though it says it quite keyboard its fair amount louder than silent keyboard like the logitech one the led are nice and able to adjust the brightness find this helpful because work in dark room at my pc the dongle is able to connect easily and has good reception the keystrokes are reliable and the keyboard well built with not completely smooth keys personally like the small amount of texture on the keys the keyboard also goes to sleep after maybe minute to save battery life charged it when got it and have been using it for days with heavy use of those days all in all solid keyboard for reasonable price ,118,5.0

positive,i like this keyboard because it is huge improvement over my old non backlit unit do believe that there is alot of room for us older folks with sight problems the back lighting would be much improved by making it all one color either bright white or the bright green increasing the size of the letters numbers and symbols would also help the unit functiond well and it was easy to put into operation it is very light weight and is not as flimsy as some others who have rated it have mentioned it is keyboard not hammer ,98,5.0

negative,i was very excited about this keyboard but unfortunately it has been very bad experience in general it is as presented in the advertisement but after using it for minutes it stops working completely even when it is turned on tried reinstalling the drivers changing the usb port and trying it with another computer but did not get good results it does not work after few minutes am very disappointed that wasted my money on this product ,77,2.0
positive,y all now know that haven had this keyboard long at all weeks but it is game changer the sound of the keys isn too loud but it not so soft that you feel unproductive love the way that the keys actually feel when am typing the color of the keyboard is great too would purchase this keyboard at full price all over again if had to primeday,68,5.0

neutral,very short charge life also keyboard was hard to use,10,5.0
neutral,this is good rechargeable keyboard that holds charge for long time you can still use the keyboard when it is plugged into usb port for charging placement of keys is taking some getting used to in particular the enter key as touch typist find myself hitting wrong keys when should be connecting with the enter key frustrating,57,5.0
positive,it an awesome keyboard for any budget build rgb lights are great comes with different modes for the lights it quiet and they have amazing customer support ,27,4.0
positive,ive had this about year the key board worked great if the receiver is infront of my pc my keyboard is only ever ft away it has slowly come to thiscurrently foot and half away and have to pick it up to type while it plugged in to bring it closer ths sna sewt rendem is what was received while trying to say this is only somewhat recent development ,69,5.0
positive,the keyboard is quiet and the backlight is really nice the keyboard is functioning correctly as am typing the review right now however the design itself has some problems if were to describe the feeling of typing on it it feels somewhat sticky as though am typing into quicksand this is likely because for the design to be quiet it blunts the speed of key pressing and returning to its original position honestly wouldn have minded the noise if it meant better typing experience as it feels like actually expending effort to type each key the charger port also has issues with the male usb cable plugging in it has lots of resistance and only goes in like mm with exposed metal when the charge is active all in all think the keyboard is nice and the bluetooth feature is godsend but the quality is pushing the envelope in satisfaction ,150,5.0
positive,very quiet and comfortable great response time ,7,2.0
positive,connects easy and the keys type well well made and not heavy if you need to travel with it ,19,3.0
positive,definitely not quiet at all other then that it okay guess,11,4.0
positive,this is the first fancy keyboard ve bought and it worth it use it mainly for my tv when connect my laptop to it the range seems to be pretty far too ,32,5.0
positive,great keyboard connects quickly to pc and the battery last decent amount of time the only thing wish it had that it doesn would be that the light constantly stays on but unfortunately it does not not big deal though the first keyboard they sent to me was not registering every key pressed but it was never specific to any specific keys contacted customer support regarding the issue and after having me run few tests they determined the keyboard was defective and sent me new one within two days great company,91,5.0
positive,this keyboard is easy on the eyes and very responsive you can also drop it and spill water on it and it just keeps on ticking ,26,5.0
positive,i love this keyboard,4,5.0
positive,alright purchased this product about years ago and it has gotten regular use over all for what it is it is good product for good price do wish there was an option to dim or turn off the led lights when using the keyboard but that fairly small issue my one frustration is this there is no place on the keyboard to store the wireless dongle the slot it comes packaged in is just rectangular hole in the back of the board with tape over it once it is unpackaged and getting used regularly not having place to lock the dongle in to the keyboard when transporting it creates risk of losing the tiny little bt dongle which is exactly what happened to me when moved my home office so was without use of this keyboard for about weeks the good news is that when contacted klim they were happy to mail out new dongle free of charge in fact the first one they sent got lost in the mail so they happily sent second replacement free as well and tracked the package this time so the product is middle of the road and could use some engineering improvements but it worth the money and more importantly the customer service is star ,212,5.0
positive,everything sumply best keyboard ever,5,2.0
positive,love it stays charges for good long while ,8,5.0
positive,update days later and the receiver has started to experience an internal fault it is loosing connection with my pc and acting as if removed the receiver from the usb port windows is even playing disconnected chime moving to new port does not fix the problem it uses windows drivers so there no update it seems to have started about week after the last version update am running windows version maybe it needs firmware update also if you go to the website listed for support in the us they don have any electronics on the site only outdoor gear confusing plus it not support they are only open mst pros will start by saying that appreciate that the charging port is type that makes it easier to charge given that most pc electronics are going that way the battery lasts about week between charges for me with about hours of use per day it also lot more responsive than my old wireless logi ch keyboard like noticed difference in rocket league immediately backlight is ok have it set to solid and med bright cons it not true rgb backlight there are only options for color on the lighting wave or solid on it just different color leds in the backlight the keyboard layout is also different from my old keyboard the enter key is tall instead of double key width so when type end up hitting the key instead of enter and when you re in game short on time you don need missed keys if you want an rgb keyboard this is not the one you want if you want responsive wireless keyboard with multicolor backlight this might be the one for you ,284,1.0
neutral,feels very light weight and doesn sit tight if you touch type you will most likely find this unsuitable for daily fast moving entry ,24,1.0
positive,it is very nice keyboard the feel is soft yet mechanical battery charge time seems sufficient and the rgb is perfect brightness and at did not expect any color brightness control so that is sufficient in my eyes as well it needs better feeling charging port it does not feel like it connects or goes in all the way the cord is severe charging restriction in other words if you use it to charge phone the phone will charge in slow charge mode but maybe it is on purpose to keep the batteries from overheating suggest making sure to use only that cord for it the keys are little squishy for extended use but over time and use suspect that will wear away and leave light feeling touch which will be decent for gaming and typing ,136,1.0
positive,works as expected wish is nice because the refurbished one did not ,12,5.0
positive,might not be ideal for gaming because of the lag but works perfectly for of the situations one charge lasts days of very heavy usage so it convenient at the time of my purchase this was the only wireless backlit proper keyboard and still happy with the purchase ,48,1.0
positive,i love my new keyboard love that the keys are not flat the best part is they light up it makes typing so much easier those that complain about the space bar being loud it isn if you hit it in the middle have had no issues and my typing is way better than the flat one was using it is very comfortable to type and doesn take up lot of space perfect ,73,1.0

positive,never got to actually use this for real my computer wasn built when initially bought it but it was functional at least with my laptop but soon as was ready to use it on my desktop it won work for anything the only reason am giving this more than star is the seller at least tried and replaced this receiver when thought that was the problem but unfortunately this is cheaply made keyboard and basically you get what you pay for don expect robust quality with this thing,88,2.0

negative,do not use this keyboard if you are programmer and need the backslash key often typically this key is to the right of the close bracket key instead its row lower this requires you majorly change how you code you can even remap the key to something else simply because theres no other key to remap it to ,58,5.0

negative, cannot type in frequently for no reason when it not working it connected with pc for sure because tab alt was working but others like space enter delete and all have no reactions using my phone to write this review because can type in amazon com in my browser if it only happened time that fine the problem is it happened several times so frustrated ,65,2.0

neutral,incredibly inconsistent keyboard regularly misses strokes and does not work with basic windows shortcuts anything requiring press of left ctrl and shift does not work dont waste your money,29,5.0
positive,i like the adjustable backlighting the way the keys feel and how quiet they are most of all like the klim technical support had trouble coordinating the chroma keyboard with the blaze mouse because of interference klim responded very quickly and their very first suggestion worked appreciate quality products and just as importantly prompt friendly and effective technical support ,59,4.0
positive,battery life is long black lighting is really nice and key typing noise is nice not too loud also good price would recommend ,23,1.0

positive,work great for what got it for,7,5.0
negative,not going to lie not particularly impressed with this keyboard the reaction time is not all that great but what is really annoying is that there is no warning when the battery is low so you can be playing game and suddenly it stops working also no way that have found to tell how charged it is,57,1.0
positive,i love the keyboard just wish there was switch to keep the lights on while using it but actually understand that it would require it to be charged more so either way love the freaking keyboard it made my work life little more simplified ,44,5.0

neutral,nice gaming keyboard for the price ,6,3.0
positive,this was great find for me have an ergonomic computer desk that raises to standing as needed the keyboard drawer is not wide and other keyboards hung out the back and front this one fits fine and still feels like as it is regular keyboard like the indicator lights caps numlock etc are well lit when on and the technicolor backlighting is nice to see and let me know everything is working ,72,1.0
neutral,not actually wireless in the way mac users need it still requires port for dongle which makes it not mac compatible,21,1.0
positive,i wasn looking to spend the amount of money did one this unit but really glad did even though it not the most ergonomic keyboard it serves its purpose and does exactly what need it to do not to mention that the lights which light up the letters very well make it easier to find some of the lesser known and used keys plus it uses the same usb charger that everything else uses win win ,76,3.0
positive,love how the colors light up when using it ,9,4.0
positive,this is great keyboard and really enjoyed it ,8,5.0
positive,this klim would likely be an incredible gamer keyboard which is what it made for it sturdy has cool multi colored backlight so as long as you re young and or can type without looking at the keys you ll probably love it wanted backlit bluetooth keyboard for my laptop but the klim multicolor backlighting made the keys appear inconsistent and so were difficult to read the top characters of some keys didn light up as well as the bottom ones on the same key and found the different colors simultaneously left to right across the board added variability to the characters that impacted their legibility for me ended up keeping seenda much thinner and flatter adjustable backlighting in choice of several colors but only one at time so the keys were consistently bright sharp and clear ,137,5.0

positive,the led lights are nice have tried it out it good keyboard no problems yet,15,2.0
neutral,not sure why but this keyboard worked fine for about months and then poof no more just wouldn connect to my windows pc at all before that would have given it stars as it had the return button in weird placement compared to standard keyboards and it did seem to need charging more frequently than would have liked ,58,5.0
positive,i am super impressed and very happy to receive an replacement key board over months after made the purchase their customer service staff is very attentive and went over trouble shoot procedures with me when that did not help they have arranged for an replacement which have received few weeks ago will definitely stay with the brand gave stars to rate gaming performance because did not use for gaming will definitely give stars for their customer services because they do care good show ,83,5.0
neutral,i ve had this keyboard for while and it finally ran out of battery to my surprise it doesn charge at all tried different chargers and nothing works spend little more and get product that doesn just die forever the first time it runs out of juice ,47,5.0

negative,i wanted to like this keyboard but months old and it dead battery life wasn anywhere near the advertised time be prepared for dead keyboard after couple hours playing time ,30,5.0
negative,i am not great typist this keyboard has terrible problem keeping up with the typist have used it several times for word processing and spreadsheet applications on my pc because look at the keyboard when type find out after minute or so of typing look up and find over third of what typed is full of missed letters entire words are missing parts of words are run together the keyboard just doesn register all of my keystrokes have even tried slowing down and being even more deliberate about my touches on the keystrokes same result sending this back for sure ,100,5.0
neutral,product didn work straight out of the box unfortunately we didn get to use the product within the return window so out the cost of the product never could get it to connect even though we followed the troubleshooting guide downloaded from the manufacturer light came on when you typed but nothing every showed on the screen not impressed though with the hour charge use stated on the box for that you might as well get wireless unit with batteries ,80,1.0
positive,these people have been wonderful to work with purchased the keyboard and it stopped working the keyboard stopped communicating with the small usb plugin sent them an email letting them know and the replied quickly gave me some suggestion to try did so but it still did not work they were so kind and send me new keyboard right away it came in very short period of time and then followed up with me as to if received the keyboard and was there anything else they could do for me they were wonderful would not hesitate to purchase from them ,100,1.0
positive,awesome buying another one for my smart tvs ,8,1.0
neutral,feels durable and not fragile like the others worth the couple extra bucks over victsing ,15,4.0
positive,it just okay for me it isn so quiet that would recommend it for quiet office but it quieter than standard keyboards the lighting effects are alright but they go to sleep after only few seconds and there no way to modify that there also no way to see the remaining battery power that ve found yet it was easy to setup but it worth noting that plugging the keyboard in with the charging cable doesn actually connect it to the pc so you still have to have the wireless receiver plugged in taking up an additional usb slot overall the keyboard just doesn impress me ve got half dozen other boards ve tried and ll probably try steel framed quiet mechanical keyboard next ,124,2.0
positive,i picked this keyboard since it one of the few out there that still have the old school design with big tall enter button instead of the wide one was very pleasantly surprised with how nice typing feels and how quiet it is these were the main requirements had and happy to say it ticks all boxes only wished it operated with replaceable batteries as those tend to last longer in my experience instead it has you charging the built in battery with cable which lasts about weeks before needing to recharge it but that was my fault for not paying attention to the description other than that noticed the space key is slightly louder than the rest of the keys but really this is just nit picking and not noticeable when typing normally overall really very happy with my purchase ,141,5.0
neutral,keyboard went out when drop of coffee landed on the space bar turned upside down and blew it out half the keys don work now ,25,4.0
neutral,very nice keyboard fast shipping,5,1.0
positive, awesome keyboard only issue have with it is super minor the space bar key is so loud all the other keys are just fine the space bar just doesn have enough connectors for its length so it makes really loud click ,41,4.0
neutral,it nice laptop but won say it for hardcore gamers the backlight stays rainbow colored and will turn on after few seconds of non use which makes it difficult to use it in the dark have to hit the spacebar just to turn the lights back on and that annoying the wireless feature is nice and ve had no real issues other than the light problem ,66,5.0
neutral,it very nice,3,5.0

neutral,quiet typing no latency only issue is that it doesn stay charged for long stays charged for about days and light doesn show when it needs to be charged other than that it is pretty good keyboard ,37,1.0

positive,i very happy with the keyboard got it was well packaged and is very easy to use do enjoy the minimal sound and the texture of the keys the only key that is bit harsh on the fingers in the space bar but the rest is very nice and smooth the lights go off whenever the keyboard is not in use ,61,2.0
positive,if you want great keyboard without the high price then this it it is quiet unless you pound the keys don know how long the charge last as charge it at night the keyboard is spill proof spilled coffee on it and after drying all night it was working great again the seller was quick to respond to email about it not working after spilling and told what to do which had already done they stated they would stand by warranty but didn need it as for adjusting the lightening haven tried as like it as it is would recommend buy wrist support for keyboard got one for about that included one for keyboard and mouse on amazon ,118,5.0

negative,when first got this keyboard noticed that my passwords were often wrong though knew had typed them correctly missing keys started showing in browsers and and applications alike there was no rhyme or reason to it about of key strokes just didn appear sometimes angrily pressing the same key or times in row produced no result thought that it might be low battery without the warning light even when left the usb cable plugged in all the time performance did not improve if you use this keyboard for gaming you will suffer lots of premature death if you use it for work you will suffer crippling frustration am using mine as paper weight having switched back to an old dell keyboard that came with my tower pc years ago the battery life did not impress even with the brightness somewhat muted the tactile feedback is poor too it just always had an un satisfying feel ,155,5.0

negative,the keyboard feels great looks great but it not nearly special enough for how often it needs to be plugged in it has died on me in the worst situations never any sort of warning and happens roughly once every weeks would much rather have hardwired or battery operated keyboard than this battery life is frankly unacceptable,57,4.0

positive,the back light is very nice some of the top keys don have the clearest numbering lettering but if you know where the keys are this is very minor wish the back light had an adjustable sleep timer one charge lasts long time and you can still use the keyboard while it plugged in for charging the charging cable isn very long but can easily be combined with usb extension cord the ergonomic design and curved keys offer comfort during many hours of use ,84,3.0
neutral,worked only until couldn return it anymore ,7,5.0
positive,ive been looking for nice keyboard for my custom built gaming school home use pc and am more than pleased with this keyboard input lag is comparable to my logitech wired keyboard and ive played titanfall with it and love it battery life seems great as ive used this product all night and its still going strong the keys are great not quite as ratifying as clicky mechanical keyboard but very close the backlighting is beautiful the colors are clear and sharp but not overwhelmingly bright the shape key travel and spacing make this keyboard an absolute pleasure to work play with its lightweight but sturdy as you would actually have to put alot of force into bending or twisting the board to hurt it personally im certain that it would take alot of high drops onto concrete to actually hurt this thing all in all great product for great price and stoked to have it ive actually typed this review with the keyboard ,164,4.0
neutral, the keyboard is nice and quiet and feels great to type on the achilles heel is the space bar arguably the most used key on the board produces cacophonous smack upon use all the keys are silent but the space bar just want to wake the neighbors it very distracting ,50,5.0
positive,works pretty good,3,5.0
positive,this worked fine but you can change the lighting but after about week of use it shut off and is dead even after charging every night batteries won charge lights won come on checked the battery with volt meter and it shows volts it won charge ,46,5.0
positive,i do like the pretty lights and how you can easily use this keyboard in dark room otoh those pretty lights burn the batteries quite quickly so it isn really wireless keyboard it best to keep it plugged in and charging most of the time but that true of basically all wireless lighted keyboards the big problem had was that it just never got along with my computer mac running big sur several times day would have to unplug the wireless dongle shut off the keyboard and then plug in and power up again even then sometimes had to restart the computer after week or so of that gave up and returned the keyboard ,114,5.0

positive,i have been using the keyboard for several months now for occasional gaming absolutley love how quiet it is the connection is very easy battery life long have only charged it once and very comfortable to use wish the backlight stayed on longer though just bought another klim keyboard for work ,51,1.0
negative,i wanted to get wireless backlit keyboard for my home pc something could use throughout my office without having to be directly next to my computer this keyboard looks great the keys themselves have nice travel for easy typing and the charge lasts for very long period of time but the lack of an always on feature for the backlit is very annoying understand it always being on would kill the battery quickly but this is rechargeable keyboard so losing some time to have to charge isn big deal for me it just feels odd that they wouldn just add an always on function for those who would want that often reviewing other peoples work or just reading through instructions so often don type for seconds at time so the lights are constantly going off again understand the reason and it not huge problem but it just feels like it would have been so easy to have an always on function added overall good keyboard but unfortunately for me it just not good fit for how use my keyboard ,179,5.0

neutral,after maybe three months of use started experiencing issues with it staying powered on and connecting to my pc would try typing and the keys simply wouldn work and would keep turning off overall my experience with this keyboard has been very poor and don recommend it ,47,5.0
neutral,the keys are very soft when hitting which makes for nice feel to keyboard like that the sleep mode kicks in after minute or so of no use translating to longer battery life before having to plug in and charge the color does only stay at one spot it doesn breathe or anything will update in couple of weeks if needed ,61,1.0
neutral,the and keys sometimes the key and the enter key just stopped working two months after bought this thing never leave reviews but this is truly unacceptable do not buy period ,31,5.0
neutral,this keyboards look nice and lighted up from the outside but when it comes to using it it is very unreliable and will stop working on you unexpectedly bought this back in early decemebr soon got it it was not connecting to my laptops made sure keyboard was fully charged and ready to go and tested it on two different laptops and nothing reached out to their it customer service and said the dongle has stopped working and would send me another one in days had to wait days for replacement mind you am working from home and really giving this keyboard chance dongle came followed the intructions and reset the keyboard and it worked this was by end of december its february and it stopped working today so far it lasted little over month before having the same issue all over again this is huge waste of time especially when having to work from home and having to stop and try to reset and test with multiple computers and still nothing this time it can be the dongle when inserted it reads int he computer do not recommend ,189,5.0

positive,so it possible this is good device however the keyboard receiver combo received is triple malfunctioning it lags excessively between input and recognition tried all usb ports to confirm the sleep mode activates within seconds of disuse so even input tests are wonky and receiving range is maybe ft at best ,51,3.0
positive,grandson loved it for gaming ,5,4.0
negative, this keyboard is nice for the money the colors are very cool and the keys are really quiet however the space bar is audibly loud when pressed and find it distracting also they they have configured the return key different and put the back slash key before the return key which has made the stretch harder so every time try and hit the return key am hitting the forward slash key also very irritating normally that back slash key is above the return key have attached video and pictures of what am talking about am not sure if will keep it or not ,103,3.0

positive,wow what great keyboard that makes typing fun keys are well spaced if you use shortcuts frequently this will really help does not feel cheap at all the construction is top notch and the key sound is an elegant clicky pump sound as far as can tell rgb color pattern is the only color choice but many ways to tune the back lighting effect to your taste super happy with the purchase ,72,3.0

positive,i just recently got into using mouse and keyboard for fps games such as cod and this is my first keyboard overall good keyboard keys are firm but press easy some buttons are shaped different than usual but that makes it easier to use them ie the enter button sweet color display goes into sleep mode after about minutes of not use to conserve battery but shoots right on as soon as you hit button over good keyboard works with xbox one,82,5.0
positive,only wish is that it had battery meter but it otherwise great purchase,13,2.0
negative,after months it started missing key stokes or double entering letters you would think it would last longer than months before having issues like this it is hard to respond quickly to things when you have to keep going back to correct words that are either missing letter or have too many letters quite disappointing time to find new keyboard ,60,1.0

negative,for starters the box came cut up dont know the reason anyone would have to cut pff part of the product box maybe im being paranoid dont know also as you can see on the pictures the keyboard was totally dirty with dust stains some minor scratches here and there and what seems to be food crumbs under keys leads me to think this was being used already by seller previous to selling as brand new lights look cool amd it conmects fine to my laptop but the lack of hygiene is what got to me dont buy ,98,5.0
neutral,i bought this keyboard because it seemed like deal with the backlit and silent key features found the backlit features to be almost irrelevant when using in the dark because the alternating and dark colors made it difficult to see put silent keys in quotation marks because they re not really silent the keys felt no different than basic keyboard that you can buy for if you re looking for good quality and can spend more suggest logitech that why immediately unhooked it and returned it so can go back to buying the logitech ,94,3.0

negative,there is just so much to dislike about this keyboard now that have used it for awhile first there is no indication of battery status second the on time before the lights turn off when inactive is too brief and not adjustable third the battery life is very short so it easiest just to leave it plugged in which defeats the purpose fourth the action keys for sound don connect to the computer and are therefore worthless fifth it is obnoxious that there is little divot in the enter key and the key is tucked in there it is far too easy to hit the backslash when you think you are hitting enter sixth it is cheaply made and feels flimsy am ordering from someone else and will gladly dump this one in the trash ,135,5.0

positive,likes works good for the price and is pretty good for membrane keyboard the battery seems to last quite long time didn actually time it the keyboard goes to sleep pretty fast to conserve battery life also can be con cons this is why it is cheap so the cons are to be expected for keyboard at this price point the keyboard flexes the rgb is very limited would of liked an option for solid color the keyboard shuts off even when plugged in probably the biggest downside the space bar is clacky and doesn feel as solid as the other keys if you want decent keyboard that is fairly cheap and works as advertised this isn bad buy ,119,4.0
positive,i work at place that supplies cheap basic keyboards and splurged to make my workday better with something that makes me happy how did they let you order that mine is crap etc bought it with my own money to make me smile with the rainbow at my finger tips muhaha love it ,53,5.0

neutral,exelente,1,2.0
negative,excellent feel but no warning when battery about to die which negates it for competitive gaming enter key also has horrible design and placement for work the dongle does not work if using kvm switch or if direct line of sight is not allowed if you can snag used one for less than new price it may be worth it but would not buy again ,65,5.0
positive,wanted keyboard to work with by xbox this works really well and am glad made the purchase ,17,1.0

positive,i will be returning this overall it fine but isn what need if you aren fast typer and don use the ctrl and other functions like it it will be good for you there is lag in the keys and frequently have to retype words because it misses letters as type it also has to be in direct sight of the usb otherwise it doesn work the ctrl and other functions like it do not work and use these frequently they also for some reason redesigned the keyboard so the backslash is where the enter key usually is and the enter key is farther away have small hands as it is so cannot reach the enter key without picking up my hand which in inconvenient when doing things like typing an essay finally more of an aesthetic thing than anything do not like that the backlighting turns off without use the colors are pretty but want them to stay on so can still see the keyboard could understand it turning off after something like five or ten minutes of inactivity but it turns off after few seconds liked the idea of this keyboard but it just won work for me it lightweight the colors are nice the clack of the keys is the perfect volume and like that it has battery light but there are too many cons for me to keep it ,233,3.0

positive,this is good quiet keyboard bought it because my wife and share one living room which is also where write on my laptop keyboard noise was driving her nuts bought this wireless keyboard because it was advertised as quiet it really is quieter made it even less noisy by putting piece of towel under it that has really helped my marriage survive during the pandemic cooped up together the keyboard lighting is nice prefer lighted keyboard since sometimes wake up can sleep and start writing another chapter for book that may someday be bestseller the keyboard charged up easily with the short usb cord included the charge usually lasted one to two weeks between charging even when forgot to use the switch underneath to turn it off for the night when the battery died the keyboard was instantly usable again as soon as plugged it into the laptop have just one small grumble writer not gamer when typing fast want large enter button on this keyboard it is little smaller in order to make room for backslash key find myself getting lot of backslashes instead of new paragraphs this happened with different keyboard few years ago which threw away due to aggravation for this quiet keyboard however the configuration is not so aggravating for now its quietness is terrific other than the extra backslash key the keyboard action is nice feels great can write for hours when not interrupted by my dog hope this is helpful for someone be well ,250,4.0
negative,well it was good while it lasted for year but will never buy an off brand wireless gaming keyboard again battery sucks on this keyboard had to charge it at least once week it was so annoying that just left the cable on the keyboard which defy the purpose of getting wireless keyboard then the keyboard would start having weird behavior it would freeze up or if type it would get stuck on letter and repeat it times so done with this junk fyi rarely used this keyboard for gaming only use it for everything web surfing need the illuminated light cause my work space is dark ,107,1.0

positive,works great no issues with my unit power button feels bit flimsy saw other reviewers complaining about it breaking and could see that happening am careful with mine and don use it frequently can change the color away from rainbow but you can alter the effect slightly didn get this for robust color features so this doesn bother me the keys are bit less diverted and less resistant then what used to frequently hit multiple keys while attempting to push one might bother another with sloppy hands like mine but look at it like challenge now that all being said this is hands down great option for wireless gaming there are slightly cheaper keyboards that tout these specs but they seem to be either too cheaply made or have to many reported issues for me to expect quality product on this note this keyboard is rechargeable there are other cheaper brands with similar products but they are mostly battery operated other issues in fact bought keyboard here on amazon that was similar no lights and used batteries it didn work upon arrival this was my second purchase got this for gaming wirelessly and use it with additonal ghz receivers no issues haven noticed any input delay but sit pretty close to the receiver so distance isn something have stress tested currently this is the keyboard would recommend for wireless gaming under ,231,4.0
positive,first of all the keyboard is far from silent every time hit the space bar there is loud and very audible clack secondly just know that you can change the color scheme it just rainbow colored the whole time you can change the brightness and the speed it breathes but that it on the plus side it was ergonomic and comfortable for the minutes used it before unplugging it and preparing it for return so there that guess all in all like said returning it this is not what wanted or expected ,92,3.0
positive,perfect christmas gift,3,4.0
neutral,the keyboard must be either front left or right of the keyboard not behind you like to use my computer while kicking up my legs with my wireless keyboard on my lap can do it well all the time because of the range is so poor on this keyboard would need to move the entire tower another part of the room to suit my sitting style or buy usb extender and hopefully move the signal usb stick that comes with the keyboard to in front of me than my tower being behind me ,93,1.0

negative,i just upgraded from budget wired keyboard to this my first wireless keyboard pros types quiet keys are responsive and smooth old budget keyboard was hurting my fingers from extended use feels light and minimalist had long sittings without needing to recharge with backlight turned off it uses usb charger cons no dedicated buttons for volume etc there are function shortcuts fn key for volume control and calculator this is nitpicking but guess rather have the dedicated buttons for one press instead of hitting the two combined the lighting has distinct high pitched noise that is audible and frustrating had to turn it off completely didn buy it for the backlight but it still shame that can ever use it ,120,1.0
neutral,i like the fact can see the keys at night hate the fact that two out of four receiver stopped working still love the two that working ,27,5.0
neutral,i only bought this for the silent keys have newborn baby and needed silent clicks but this keyboard was more loud than my current gaming keyboard if you need reviews on anything else please read elsewhere didn even connect it simply started typing and was disappointed stars being generousmaybe the company is comparing their keys to mechanical stroke keyboard if that were the case then every keyboard would be silent compared to those ,73,5.0
negative,not sure why my mice will run charge for several days on single triple battery but this keyboard dies within days of being unplugged basically leave it plugged in all the time now which defeats the purpose of wireless keyboard ,40,5.0

positive,the good easy plug and play connection keys are lit up real good and easy to see in the dark keys have nice feel to them and are relatively quiet so far battery charge lasts the whole day of pretty solid gaming the bad user manual is kinda so so backlighting turns off kinda quickly and sure that can be adjusted but again the user manual is kinda so so ,70,5.0
positive, light weight but feels solid you feel the keys but no loud clicks easy to adjust the brightness and lighting modes wish there was way to adjust the sleep timer but other than that love it haven had it long enough to comment on the battery live but their usb is little short not major issue for me have spares up to feet long update on the battery life it great obviously it depends on use but it lasts as long if not longer than other rechargeable keyboards have used the usb recharges it fast when you need it to also have klim blaze wireless mouse and fusion earbuds love can use the same cable to charge the mouse and keyboard the earbuds have much longer cable than most ideal for moving around while you are plugged in to the computer ,141,5.0
neutral,this is almost decent keyboard unfortunately some keys are in very unusual positions for example single apostrophe should be directly left of enter key and backslash should be directly above it this may not be important for casuals but this is anathema for coders didn use it long enough to test battery life ,53,1.0
neutral,i like everything about it,5,1.0
negative,i am so angry now the battery life was short had to charge very short time after first use it was out of battery again today so changed it it worked for about minutes after charged then stopped responding tried all usb ports of my laptop all working so it the keyboard tried wireless or wired doesn work it just doesn work ,62,5.0

positive,klim customer service is amazing first keyboard got wouldn connect and became dud within weeks of use they sent brand new one and it been perfect still use it and it good for generic typing however after continuous everyday use for hours week ve begun to choose to only use it on days may be less busy typing less quickly the longer use it or the more have to quickly type it will glitch out it adds unnecessary keys know did not hit or will duplicate key stroke hello looks like heelloo all in all good witless keyboard love that it can be charged with cord battery life is great wakes up quickly and has good response time after sleeping it just can be expected to put up with long intermittent time frames of over wpm typing ,137,5.0
neutral,i like the lighted keybd,5,4.0
neutral,this was gift don know how it is doing,9,4.0
neutral,this was replacement for another expensive illuminated keyboard which got wet findillumination and wireless operation to be very handy the fact that it is water proof or even water resistant is bonus it is not completely silent keyboard but there is very little sound key action is not quite as firm as mechanical keyboard but not squishy battery life remains to be seen but it is casually used daily for at least hours with no issues and only charged it once in week an charge indicator led would be plus so far it has performed very well and met expectations ,100,1.0
neutral,this keyboard has range of about inches and minutes of game time it is not responsive and most likely the chat will have moved on by the time the keyboard decides to start inputting what you are typing had it for less than week ,44,5.0

neutral,it does what it supposed to do ,7,1.0
positive,this keyboard is excellent would buy it again use it for gaming have no complaints in that regard have set up where my pc is in another separate room from my bedroom it connected to my tv via foot hdmi power cables even through the wall it still manages to get good reception with minimal lag occasionally if positioned really far away in my bedroom on my bed rather than in my gaming chair it will have some brief noticeable lag but if turn it off turn it on again it goes back to normal this issue won be problem for most people since they will likely be in the same room as their pc don want to don like the noise however small that any pc makes the biggest issue have with this keyboard is the sound it makes when the rgb is on it this high pitched squealing sound it goes away as soon as the rgb is turned off this isn problem for me since don care about rgb one bit and prefer to have it off so it saves battery but everytime the keyboard turns on the rgb is automatically on and hence the sound is immediately there when turn it on and have to turn it off everytime which is minor inconvenience then again probably have to do turn it off anyways since turn off the lighting to save battery but the sound is noticeable it not as loud as computer fan or anything but since it high pitched you won not notice it ,259,1.0
negative,wouldn take charge and charge light kept turning off just as bad the keyboard lighting wouldn stay on which defeats its whole purpose very disappointed and returning product ,28,5.0

positive,i have the klim wireless keyboard and like it quite bit my work space is rather limited and find it handy to pick up the keyboard and move it out of the way while am multi tasking it also handy that the keyboard lights up as my eyes get tired and often forget to put my glasses on so the light up keys are helpful do wish the on off switch was in handier place however however am not gamer so don know how it might rate in that category otherwise like the keyboard for all other reasons weight size price and overall usage ,104,5.0
positive,smooth feeling keys nice design,5,5.0
positive,so got it for my boyfriend who wanted gaming keyboard but no wire it was on time in the mail looked like it was returned item with all the tape trying to keep the box together but as it came in the original packaging it makes sense while it was plugged in we turned it on to see the lights it was very low with other lights interfering but visible at night or in darkness we left it to charge as instructed and it never charged when it was it lasted minutes at most the keyboard connected to the laptop as we saw it under the devices but it wouldn type or send any sort of input in overall wasn good buy on my part but for gift for gamer boyfriend who hage wires he liked it while it lasted ,140,4.0

positive,this is my third try at wireless backlit keyboard the first two were from different manufacturers the first two consistently duplicated and omitted many keystrokes finally found one that does what expected it to do the adjustable brightness backlight works fine and all keystrokes are accurate the key profiles are not as tall as other products in this category which is good for me wouldn think that should matter but found the taller keys on some of the others to be annoying like the somewhat minimal footprint for full feature keyboard as space on my desk is limited don use this for gaming but sometimes have to get up in the middle of the night for work call and the adjustable brightness backlit keyboard is welcome feature so don have to turn on the room lights for two minutes of computer work at am overall am very pleased ,148,1.0

negative,nothing special about this keyboard not fond of the manufacturers website adding to this review after less than year of use the battery is failing one of the issues is the forced keyboard lighting there is no way to turn it off while the keyboard saw heavy use the main function wireless is hampered by poor design am reducing my review to reflect this issue after testing do not recommend this product ,72,5.0

neutral,worked great the first week stopped holding charge and working after the second week sent back after month of having because it wasn worth the effort of charging to full only for it to work for hours if at all can even have it plugged in and charging while using so that wasn even possible work around bought different brand and have been using for few months without any issues don waste your time with this wireless keyboard ,78,5.0

positive,absolutely in love exceeded expectations highly reccomend ,7,5.0
positive,this keyboard looks and feels really nice it nice and quiet and like the rainbow color display don game much so can really opine on its quality there but imagine the feel and reach of it is nice for those that do although that big enter button might throw you off little bit if you re not used to the layout kept hitting the insert key instead of the backspace from time to time have screen display two are daisy chained monitors using displayport and one is tv using hdmi noticed that in its regular position on my desk it seemed to type fine on screen have somewhat delayed buggy input on screen and perhaps due to the distance between the dongle and the tv no response on there moved the dongle to the keyboard to the top of my tower instead of the back side but it still didn accept any input from my keyboard when wasn even feet away from my computer to me that on top of not seeming to properly respond to my other screens is large drawback for wireless keyboard especially when paid for it had cheaper logitech that worked just fine for about feet and only got this one because it died three years later to the day and that model seems to be discontinued want to like this because it works great when it wants to but the problems ve had just in the first week aren worth what paid for it almost never return anything but think gonna have to with this ,260,5.0

neutral,constantly lags or just stops working while trying to type even when the battery is full ,16,5.0
neutral,the keys themselves are fairly quiet but the space bar appears to only be anchored in one spot so it clicks when you press it calling this keyboard silent is false advertising also have had the problem with using the left ctrl shift keys in keystroke sequence like when clearing cache or opening an incognito window which regularly need to do for work the right ctrl shift keystroke works though do like the battery life and the backlight but will be returning this and looking for something different ,88,1.0
positive,this is great keyboard the keys are quiet and don travel far when pressed down it lights up well enough to be seen clearly in the dark and despite being make out of plastic instead of aluminum it seems fairly sturdy that said this is not the keyboard for me an old school computer programmer and am on my keyboard all day long prefer loud clicky keyboard reminiscent of the old ibm pc keyboard this keyboard is nothing like that it extremely quiet and the keys don travel far when pressed was looking for borderline typewriter feel this keyboard is more for gaming and such again this is great keyboard and clearly matches its marketing it was just not the keyboard was looking for ,124,1.0
positive,purchased it for my son who is gamer he picked it out after doing the research on amazon he really enjoys the every aspect of the keyboard it is lightweight therefore he has taken it with him abroad ,38,5.0
positive,after months stopped working none of the key functions work the keyboard is fully charged should have read the negative reviews like others have said stopped working right after the return window closed also for what this cost the lighting on it should stay on constant but it doesn you have to hit key for it to come on they charge way too much for this piece of garbage amazon needs to give more than month window for returns guess ll stick to best buy for electronics if could have gave it less than one star would have ,98,3.0
negative,i wanted to do stars on this but do have slight issue with the design of the keyboard itself it may be the best keyboard you have owned really ve just broken so darn many it unfunny not this model yet my main gripe is the whole function key is right side only which wouldn be horrible for me if wasn consistently used to handed volume and media controll may have just bought the wrong keyboard there are other options this is the one bought and it was bucks and not pleased with it due to this again may work wonders for you non media junkie ,106,3.0

positive,it good keyboard with caveats in order of personal importance the key layout is different from the typical keyboards ve used in the past years the backlighting is dim at its brightest and goes out quickly maybe there way to make it persist till some timeout period the keys are tad squishy but otherwise they feel okay,57,5.0
positive,my year old daughter loves this addition to her gaming desktop ,11,5.0
neutral,the keyboard is great in general but the usb receiver broke off in my usb port after months they really should either include more than one receiver or make them more robust and of higher quality ,36,5.0
positive,cool looking and feels great ,5,4.0
neutral,the keyboard is very light and doesn feel too cheap but it never detected on my dell computer not sure if it my software windows or the keyboard but it would light up and then go dark when tried typing on it the manual didn explain anything because the keyboard is supposed to automatically be detected and work my other vic mouse and redragon keyboard work just fine returning for refund will stick with my wired for now ,78,5.0
negative,this keyboard stopped working terrible keyboard doesnt do all the function it shows to it description avoid this product way overpriced and klim support is also terrible too ,28,5.0
positive,ill start with cons unresponsive sometimes doesnt tell if the battery is low there is no indicator so if youre playing intensely and stops all of sudden it will pissed off little keyboard sound is like so and so its not mechanical it will make sound depends how heavy you type you can customize the rgb its fixed pros keyboard lights wont bother you if you play while the lights are off keyboard lights has modes which is cool steady pulse and no lights you can also adjust the light from low to high rechargable and has its own usb type cable and has its own bluetooth connector to pc when charged it lasts quite long if you play casually it can go up to to days without charging it goes on sleep mode if not in use lightweight always put this on my lap since my pc is connected to my tv and always play from my bed budget friendly its good keyboard if youre not ready for razer and corsair type of peripherals and looking for budget friendly one then give this keyboard try update am returning the keyboard as it is faulty the and quotation mark got switched its becoming more and more unresponsive got this days ago and its not doing so well update on battery it lasts days max if used casually am changing my review to star and dont recommend this now better look for something else or really invest to good brand gaming keyboard instead its waste of time and money for just little feature ,262,5.0
positive,i don game so did not find it fair to give it reviews on that factor but this keyboard is great now that am working from home and my days never seem to end this keyboard was just what needed especially for working at night ,45,4.0
positive,just like the head states the windows key no longer functions also don particularly appreciate that the lights on the keyboard do not stay illuminated for more than few seconds work on three monitors and need functioning windows key to move you guessed it my windows around using the shortcut windows shift arrow key figured it was my pc so changed to different pc in the house had the same issue then went back to my wired keyboard no problems another keyboard for the junk pile ,86,1.0

neutral,i have dark living room can see the keyboard this one glows in neon colors makes it easy to see what you are typing being cordless allows me to sit on the couch play games type mails etc without restrictions best one have had yet ,45,5.0
negative,this is good looking keyboard the rainbow colors you see are all you can get so no selection of one color is available although the brightness settings are adjustable which is nice not critical issue as said it nice looking keyboard but functionally there are couple of issues that are immediately apparent first the enter key as in the picture attached has notch in it that is shared with the key am constantly hitting the and enter resulting in failed passwords and clutters chat messages so at minimum it will take some time to get used to this and hit the enter key alone another issue seems to be battery life instructions indicate hours to charge can accept that what can accept is the life of the battery after in the short time have had this keyboard it has died on my twice within day of getting full charge so sleep function is either broken or poorly designed with regard to maintaining battery life so now am keeping it wired with the provided cable because cannot be without keyboard when it dies and plugging it into power source is not enough once the battery is dead it will not power up until it has gotten enough of charge to respond but connected to the pc via usb cable makes it online instantly overall poor technical design my only other complaint and it could just be me adapting from laptop keyboards to mechanical desktop keyboard again but typing on this keyboard continues to feel clumsy but while writing this review took moment to look closer the keys on this keyboard are probably good smaller surface area than either laptop typically use this adds to the closeness of the keys and why am constantly off key here and there typing as normally do by feel alone square key up from the base versus the pyramidal shape of these keys would make them bigger and more tolerable this is what may ultimately force me to try another keyboard and send this one back ,340,5.0
neutral,the keyboard looks and feels nice to use however have barely uses this keyboard and am encountering connection issues open up web browser go to start typing and nothing happens turn it off and on again wait few seconds then again start typing it doesnt type then again few seconds and it registered letters other times it functions properly too unrealiable ,61,1.0

neutral,the keyboard itself was lit up it was charged tried multiple usb ports and rebooted my computer also tried on another computer did not want to seem to connect wirelessly also in an attempt to get it to work thought that possibly wiring it to my computer using the charging usb port it might work just not wirelessly which did not then went through amazon tech and am now returning the product think ill be looking for another brand because im still in need of wireless backlit keyboard,88,5.0
positive,it works fine the lights are little dim but that not big deal for me really wanted it because it looked cool it wireless and my old key board was pretty noisy this one looks cool but it just as noisy an english teacher and use the computer during study hall it still makes lot of noise in quiet room ,60,4.0

neutral,great gaming keyboard not as bright as thought it would be ,11,1.0
positive,beautiful keyboard,2,4.0
negative,my only real complaint is that every time you actually turn the switch off when you switch it back on it goes back to full lights that personal preference know but only turn the lights on occasionally you should also know that the positioning of the colors is not changeable they are on pulsing on off or off no ability to change any of the lights which is fine by me but might bother other people ,76,1.0
positive,needed keyboard that was backlit but did not want just plain white use this for my desktop computer since am now working from home so can speak for gamers but for my job it been great the colors really pop and you can adjust the brightness or just turn off the color all together very happy with my purchase ,59,3.0
positive,nice wireless keyboard bought to replace logitech wireless kb that got banged around for the last couple of years the only minor gripe is wish there was bit more margin around the edge often hit key accidentally when picking it up it is light weight wise and the lighted keypad is great for dark rooms ,55,1.0

positive,nice keyboard overall the tactile feedback is pleasant although don like the placement of the key the colorful backlight is cool but some keyboard shortcuts simply do not work ctrl shift for example doesn work if you use the left ctrl shift keys that pretty outrageous since that is very common shortcut used in many apps on most operating systems it not just my keyboard this is apparently known issue with the keyboard don know how klim can sell keyboard with known defect and without warning about it ,88,4.0

positive, update after yr of usage used the keyboard almost everyday for whole year mostly for work rather than gaming and it is still like new then one day had to switch out my laptop at work and forgot to take the usb receiver before turning it in unfortunately couldn retrieve it and was beating myself up for it going back to using the laptop keys was highly excruciating so decided to take chance and ask if the usb receiver was replaceable their customer service is phenomenal the same rep communicated with me throughout the process have you ever played hot potato with customer service then you know how amazing this feels and she always responded pretty quickly to my emails there was never lag time the only hiccup ran into was at the very beginning when searched for customer service portal through amazon the initial link connected me with the klim technical riding gear rather than klim technologies however they gave me the correct email address immediately and it was smooth sailing from there they told me the usb receiver is replaceable yayyyy but that part was on backorder was more happy to know be able to continue using the keyboard so was willing to wait month later they provided an update that the part was still on backorder but that they were going to send me new one it arrived as promised and can go back to typing comfortably and with lightening speed just got it and have only used it for couple of hours but thoroughly impressed by this keyboard smooth buttons smooth typing comfortable feel and full sized buttons and now have number key pad the presentation was also impressive black little envelope with seemingly personalized note with little flare from the makers when you open the box love it just the quality of the keys make it obvious that it will be great for game play the keys feel so light and smooth under my fingers as type hope it lasts forever ,336,5.0

neutral,first and foremost have had this keyboard almost year now the first keyboard received was doa which anyone who knows much about electronics knows that that is just how it is sometimes contacted their customer support and within week had new keyboard initially this was amazing and saw no issues but as time went on it stopped charging properly believe am on my computer long hours every day as work from home and then game at night if charge it at night with the keyboard set to off it lasts the whole day normally even then sometimes it doesn but overall it does other times even while it is plugged in it shuts off randomly making gaming hard if klim were reading this would suggest two things add some way to show battery charge on the keyboard and upgrade the battery stability this keyboard after year is acting like the one that was faulty did just year later for those who are reading this would suggest this keyboard unless you use it hours day it simply isn built for that it feels like ,183,1.0

neutral, updated after five months of use the keyboard suddenly died for no reason tried all troubleshooting could and it just doesn turn on turns on for about half second and turns back off guess you get what you pay for doesn last long whatsoever original review had been looking for wireless gaming keyboard that wasn loud and had backlighting it not the perfect keyboard and didn expect it to with that price the two things would change in their second version would be to make the rgb bit more versatile or customizable to save little on battery and make the keys feel little more clicky because hard to feel if the key went through sometimes overall love the weight its durability and slick look knocked it for two things but they are picky at this point ,136,2.0

negative,bought this awhile ago to start setting up my home office didn need it right away so set the box aside pulled it out this weekend to discover that the keys don work correctly multiple keys are stuck together typing or displays tg for example keyboard is essentially useless but because didn examine it right away my return window has expired and stuck with junk that doesn work lesson learned ,70,5.0
positive,it solid keyboard it feels very light and less substantial that my previous ms wireless comfort keyboard which is still going strong after years it also feels very soft to the touch both the material itself and the key presses think part of this is in the waterproof design what really bought this for is smaller footprint than my previous keyboard it full size keyboard that requires substantially less desktop space it makes difference for my use backlighting for when typing at night and don want the harshness of an overhead light or even lamp sometimes the backlighting on this is great if you re fine with the multi color there is an option to turn it off during the day and there is also dimmer which works great what doesn work it weird but when editing text often use ctrl shift and the arrow keys to highlight large chunks of text at time so far this works on this keyboard but only if using ctrl shift keys on the left side together or the right side together it doesn fully work when use right ctrl left shift right arrow keys weird would have much preferred standard sized carriage return enter key for you youngins now to press enter my pinky has to travel much farther and it takes noticeable effort the old school reverse shaped enter key is king hope maybe on the version they will correct this if they did it would be worth buying again for that change alone still getting adjusted to the slightly new layout and key response my typing isn as fast yet find with this soft key press business have to press little more aggressively to get the space bar for instance to register it slight but noticeable whether you think that good thing or not is up to you definitely needs palm rest sensitive hands wrists may still prefer the design of curved keyboard swear by curved split keyboards they make difference don use it for gaming so no comment there imagine it responsive enough ,343,5.0

positive,at first this keyboard was everything wanted in wireless keyboard have always been skeptical of wireless keyboards it worked wonders at first but as started to work with it there would be very random connection issues where it would not register my typing this seller was kind enough to send me second keyboard even and the same issue was happening really do think it was an issue with my very many wireless electronics nearby but never found out what the issue was however gave this star rating because of how well it worked when it did and for the customer service don leave very many reviews but this seller really does deserve credit for great customer service experience as well as making great product however unfortunate it did not work for me they were even kind enough to send me gift for the inconvenience and gave me coupon voucher for their other products excellent service ,155,2.0

positive,i ll first mention that if you are buying this you probably don want to spend an arm and leg for gaming keyboard however you definitely get the most for what you pay for ve been using this keyboard for months now and though it isn as comfortable or bright as others it gets the job done don really care too much about the light features fading mode breathing mode but my biggest problem is the brightness of the light if the room is well lit you can definitely tell rgb is lit but its bit dimmer than expected at night was hoping to clearly see the major change in color between the keys on the keyboard but the keys do not allow lot of light through the transparent plastic on each key you can see the color very clearly between the keys but not so much for through each key the only improvement suggest would be to make the keyboard slightly less harsh on the hands after hours of typing and increasing the maximum brightness of the keyboard besides that the battery is fine for the price and you can still use the keyboard if the battery dies by plugging it in which is pretty convenient like said you get what you pay for and this is more than fine klim did pretty well and this keyboard has lasted me several months without any major issues ,237,1.0
positive,this is the best rgb keyboard value you can find out there the size is jsut perfect not too big or too slow ,23,5.0

positive, update still liking the keyboard after months of daily use my only two issues are the button location is terrible am mostly used to it at this point but still accidentally press instead of enter all the time although the battery life is good there is no indicator for low battery this means the keyboard will just unexpectedly stop in the middle of typing when it dead have been using this keyboard daily for the past three weeks use it about hrs day during the work week and have had to charge it twice since getting it pretty good it is by no means silent keyboard but it is much quieter than my previous keyboard and is not disruptive to my office mate husband am reasonably fast typer wpm and the keyboard is responsive don expect it to blow your mind but you will be pleasantly surprised at the quality you are getting for less than ,156,1.0
negative,the keyboard is definitely quiet but the enter key is in an awkward position if you learned how to type and don hunt and peck you will constantly be hitting the slash key rather than the enter key this gets very frustrating when trying to type reports and documents it has nice look and my kids thought it was cool with the colors but sadly it was returned due to it not being practical for my needs,77,4.0
positive,i ve used this for few months it worked great at first it would die on me after few hours of using so was pretty good about plugging it in when wasn using it now it just sometimes straight up doesn work which gets pretty frustrating ll even try to keep the power chord plugged in and turn it off and on again and it still doesn work that is very inconvenient at that point ll just have to turn it off keep it plugged in and take break from whatever doing ,92,3.0
positive,i received the keyboard with defective dongle had talk to the customer service about it and they were very nice and helpful received new one few weeks later and the new one doesnt work either looked up how to sync it with the keyboard and after many attempts it just wont work sad because the keyboard looks cool and would very much like to use it maybe it just my luck of getting defective receivers ,75,1.0
neutral,the things hate about this keyboard were mentioned in the reviews but overlooked them this product is not made in the usa even though there is an american flag displayed suggesting it is the supplied cable is only feet long and does not insert fully into the keyboard so factor in the price of foot cable that does insert as had to do finally the keyboard lights time out after minute of non use even if you leave it plugged in and battery life is not an issue ,88,2.0

positive,pros everything about this keyboard is really good the keys are super quiet like advertised my pc gaming setup is right next to our bed so if play at night when my wife is sleeping it does not wake her up because how silent the keys are the rgb light brightness controls are awesome too again allows me to keep the keyboard bright enough to see in dark without blinding me or my wife while she sleeps if game at night the color tones of the rgb lights are very nice pleasing to look at cons the keys feel sticky with every press feels as if there was sticky substance holding down the keys for fraction of second when depressed but only little not too big of deal but some gamers might find this very annoying there are only two rgb light options to choose from breathing effect and constant back lite would be nice if there were more lighting effect options ,162,5.0

positive,everything seems great so far ,5,5.0
negative,udpate you can use control shift together on the left side of the keyboard quick tab opens window movement what an abusrd error do yourself favor and buy different keyboard this keyboard hits all the nails except for the spacebar it seems to be made of an entirely different plastic than the rest of the keyboard and is distractingly loud if you re working in an office environment it likely you ll get looks from your co workers it ruins the entire keyboard experience ,84,1.0

neutral,the keyboard looks and feels great but the issue is that at times while typing or using any keys really it just stops responding for good while this has lead me to charge it until the indicator turns off fully charged and it still does this ve turned off the wireless and connected via usb and this still happens so ultimately would not recommend this because you kinda need to use all the keys at all times ,77,1.0

positive,for the price this object is probably my favorite keyboard have ever had it response great has had no issues using plug playing in different laptops plugs in and gets to working quickly so far have only charged it couple hours two separate times and have been using it for constantly playing games since bought it month or more ago so my battery life in my personal experience with this has been amazing recommend this product it is built much much better that the few other klim products have tested out well worth the money that is my two cents you do your research decide ,105,4.0

neutral,i would not recommend this keyboard loved it at first until the keys started breaking just from typing broken keys in the first month alone,25,5.0
positive,love being able to toss it on the bed when deep into my hobbying and need some space wish the backlight stayed on bit longer but then probably have to charge it more have no problem recommending this keyboard at all ,41,4.0
positive,i pretty happy with this keyboard except for one thing the enter key spans two lines and the pipe button is moved down line this small feature really slows down my typing especially in unix environment just can seem to get past that hopefully in time will but switching between keyboards will likely be an issue other than that they key board lights up nice holds charge is fairly easy to type on wish the keys were like bigger and haven tried swimming with it so can speak to the water proof part can exchange it because already recycled the box ll make it work for now ,107,5.0
negative,this is the second keyboard that ve ordered both had issues very disappointing product ,14,5.0
positive,this is great keyboard for wireless quiet typing really like the use of the colors ,15,5.0
positive,it often stops working at random points even with full charge there will be sudden fits where it won respond for good seconds or it will be super laggy with its inputs was an idiot forgot it had warranty and bought the first one at least had the courtesy to wait few months to bug out day this thing bugged but like the feel of the keyboard its damn satisfying keyboard when it works the buttons are nice to press and the keyboard feels nice in general that why bought another hoping the first was faulty the lights are nice also but sadly cant recommend it if keyboards have similar bugs hell even typing this out was an ordeal especially when was listing the positives of it will be sending it to repairs but really hope they straighten this problem out ,141,3.0

neutral,the key board looks amazing but some of the keys don work and delete to name few ,17,5.0
negative,this keyboard looks really good but the description is deceiving as they claim it to be silent or quiet this keyboard is so not close to being quiet one it has really loud keys which wasnt fan of ,38,5.0
negative,someone has missed the point there doesn seem to be way to keep the lights on either wirelessly which is the point of purchasing wireless keyboard or wired not power saving move as the shut off timing is the same with the keyboard plugged in the backlighting when it is on is not helpful as it barely shows through the key to highlight the number or letter but shows off the space around the keys so when looking down on the keyboard the eye is drawn to the space around the keys instead of the key itself completely uselessa strange design choice also interferes with the use of the keyboard there is an extra key next to the enter return which is really annoying instead of hitting enter you are more likely to hit backslash which really makes entering passwords joy this key is above the enter key on every other keyboarda very bad choice on my part from all the wireless backlit keyboards available,165,5.0
neutral,i was looking for low profile keyboard wireless and with large enter key this keyboard fits the bill ,18,1.0
positive,pros the physical design of the keyboard is great feedback on the keys is good has nice matte finish lights are as advertised and there are holes on the back of the keyboard which helps keep the keys clean and if you spill liquid on it it can drain cons couple times days the keyboard will disconnect intermittently on me it will become unresponsive and disconnect then reconnect rapidly its not for very long maybe seconds to couple minutes and if at the computer for hours day it will only happen couple times but if in the middle of game it can be quite frustrating never have had this issue with other wireless keyboards not sure what the solution is but tried reinstalling the driver ,125,2.0
neutral,this pos is advertised as made in usa it is actually made in china ,14,3.0
neutral,goes into sleep mode too quicklyno problem really seems to be good quality product,14,3.0
negative, there are few good things about this keyboard lights number keys wireless rechargeable but the space bar is major deal breaker for me was looking for quiet keyboard to take notes during videoconferencing the space bar is annoyingly loud even when typing without having to be quiet on conference call it is very annoying my partner down the hall can here me typing good features on this keyboard but really cannot stand the space bar it an instant return for me the worst part is they market this as quiet keyboard it far from quiet ,95,1.0
positive,this is great value am using with my laptop as dont like the keyboard on my laptop love this ,19,5.0
positive,so far it works great hope it stays like that ,10,1.0
positive,the keyboard feels steady the wireless connection is excellent just wish that the hand rest was at least inches long since use it on my lap ,26,1.0
neutral,i enjoy the snarkiness of the ppwk in the package minus the space bar all of the keys are very quiet gave it full charge before use it worked immediately backlighting turns off after its idle for bit simple tap of any key wakes it up dig that the backlighting is multi colored just plain white being that not planning to use it for gaming going to need to get used to the shape of the enter key there is an additional key on the middle row where would naturally hit enter no biggie minus star because the space bar is quite loud ,103,5.0
positive,great gaming keyboard,3,5.0
positive,we love it ,3,5.0
neutral,i have not had to charge the keyborad or the mouse am on my computer lot and am still running the both of them from the time first intalled the ,30,5.0

negative,crap quality several keys fell off when it was being stored not even in use and are now lost rendering the keyboard useless down the drain ,26,2.0
neutral,bluetooth range is no problem rgb color is good keys are comfortable to use but two keys stopped working use the cue key for gaming so this basically defeats the purpose of buying this keyboard ,35,5.0
negative,so basically was testing the removable keycaps to see if the they actually worked so tried it on the space bar and after took it out couldn get it back in and when got it back in it kept falling out idk if this was my fault or the keyboards fault ,51,5.0
positive, love the colors love that it can be plugged in or wireless love it with my keyboard as well ,19,3.0
positive,works great,2,5.0
positive,what like everything what dislike nothing this review is actually the first thing that typing with this new keyboard the keys feel little spaced out but ve been stuck with tiny bluetooth keyboards using my phone as my computer which this works flawlessly with the samsung galaxy note and with the dex setup which currently utilizing feel like purchased much more expensive keyboard than what paid for this the packaging and items inside are esquisite the glow of the keyboard is bright and fantasticly appealing wish this had bluetooth format but maybe the next note will feature connectivity to ghz devices ,101,3.0
neutral,after less than months it already broken space bar is already busted son had last keyboard for years and never had an issue very bummed ,25,1.0
negative,this keyboard looks fantastic especially with the breathing setting but the connectivitiy is garbage it makes gaming fristrating because the keybiard will lag you will put in an input and it will take few seconds to register if it registers at all there is also no indicator if it is about to die fully charged it still lags ,58,3.0
positive,works fine easy to install and use but there is nothing quiet about this keyboard it clacks along just like regular one not advertised as quiet ,26,2.0
neutral,although there is large american flag pictured on the product description this keyboard is made in china nowhere in the description does it say that paid premium for this keyboard for it to be made in the us and this is just false advertising ,44,3.0
positive,well just saying not sure why the price is expensive besides the lights on background of keys it is the same basic keyboard you will find in the wireless section bought cause of how cool it looks also you have to keep charging the keyboard to ensure it is fully juiced up so make sure you turn it off on the bottom so it wont die have not had to many times it died on me but how often do you remember to cut your keyboard off or plug it up other than that item is perfect ,97,5.0
neutral,highly recommended,2,2.0
positive,pos won hold charge after months of light use can return,11,2.0
positive,this is an excellent keyboard and exactly what was looking for the keys are extremely responsive and like the low profile of the keyboard also the keys are extremely quiet and the different color lighting is cool easy function button combinations controls functions such as turning the color lighting off or adjusting the dimness brightness of the lighting the packaging is great and liked the message the company provides in black envelope along with the stickers this product works great with kvm switch highly recommend ,85,1.0
positive,i had never heard of this brand and was little concerned might be buying some weird off brand that was of poor quality so glad that not the case this keyboard is all quality they keys feel amazing to type on the lighting comes with few options like adjusting brightness and the whole thing feels sturdy set up was easy of course was reading through the few inserts that come in the packaging and there even cute description of how the keyboard was shipped to me ,86,5.0
neutral,i like the color and function of this key board ,10,5.0
positive,i bought this keyboard for work wanted something quiet but also had rgb even tho there is only the basic rainbow and it not very bright for the price this keyboard is well worth it it very light for easy travel and the keys also feel surprisingly nice to type on for long periods ,54,5.0

positive,fantastic keyboard for its price,5,2.0
neutral,i surprised how highly rated this keyboard is given that the space bar isn quiet as advertised this isn manufacturing defect it the actual design besides that problem the enter key is whole key further away compared to most keyboards found myself repeatedly pressing where the key should be but that place is occupied by the backslash another problem is that in ubuntu the keyboard shortcut for create new folder doesn work on this keyboard ,75,1.0
positive,it really great keyboard the only thing don like is that you are unable to change the color other than that it perfect ,23,5.0
positive,you will be needing to charge this keyboard every day ve had keyboards that lasted for months on single charge this is definately not one of them other than that it great keyboard ,33,5.0
positive,the key doesn work pretty hard to do anything when pretty important letter is not able to be used ,19,1.0
positive,ok product for price point wish battery lasted longer the keys are little awkward have to press harder than normal keyboard but for the price happy love it in the dark wish you could change the rainbow effect to solid color but happy overall use it for work so cannot give full review for gaming but did like the fact no software needed to be installed ,66,3.0
neutral,looked nice while it lasted but it wouldn charge after two months of light use ,15,4.0
positive,i ve bought this keyboard twice now it works great for few months honestly it is my favorite keyboard ve used so when my first one went out after about months bought another unfortunately that one lasted four months and konked out as well it just does this thing where it flickers on for second then turns right off would love to buy another one but don know if can justify buying keyboard that now assume will have to repurchase in another months ,83,4.0
positive,its amazing,2,4.0
neutral,lightweight nice looking wireless fair price but it stopped working after less than year really liked this keyboard but dealing with keyboard that is outputting constant characters to the computer and can imagine how to fix it if turn this on it locks up my computer and tries typing numbers and odd ascii characters shame ,55,3.0
neutral,after using this as an everyday keyboard for six months now there are few problems with even with full charge the keyboard will randomly power off have missed keystrokes and there no way to tell how much charge is left in the battery it is quiet however but wouldn use it as an everyday keyboard ,55,5.0
neutral,some keys stopped working months of use contacted the klim for assistance and was not able to get the keyboard exchanged for new one will no longer purchase any electronics from klim ,32,5.0

positive,have been using it nonstop since got it the look of the keyboard is super sleek and nice love the colors and the auto shut off of the lights when not being used has type charger so it works great with your phone charger if you have an android phone keys do not make noise which is nice connected quickly to my laptop no problems at all wish the company would make wireless mouse to go with this keyboard though ,80,5.0
positive,has great design and excellent features ,6,5.0
positive,i really love this keyboard for the price could not have asked for better one ,15,5.0
negative,everything is perfect but the whole point while got this was because its wireless but wireless is useless if theres no reception after feets after year or so can remember it stopped working all it does now is just flashing light back and forth when try to type something in ,50,5.0
neutral,overall it is good keyboard but it runs out of battery really fast my own does not hold on for more than or days would expect to hold the battery for or weeks or even months every week have to connect into the usb port to recharge when connected to usb port still have to connect the bluetooth adapter which makes me use an extra usb port why not just use the usb cabe to also communicate with the pc why do have to use both while charging the keyboard ,90,5.0
negative,the usb receiver got stuck in my laptop usb port ended up having to get it out with pliers fortunately this didnt cause any damage to the usb port very disappointed in this product as the keyboard no longer works at all and it almost damaged my laptop the usb receiver came out in pieces at time and not sure if it even functioned properly to begin with it most definitely doesn function now ,74,1.0
positive,it seemed fine at first but then tried to type the sign eventually figured out it was on another key not great if your only using it for gaming its good keyboard if you using chat it wouldn be great ,40,1.0

neutral,good quality,2,4.0
positive,awesome,1,4.0
negative,the keyboard did not function correctly the moment opened plugged it some of the keys just don work received broken keyboard and it pain to return due to covid ,29,1.0
negative,a solid keyboard for the price the battery life is not very good and if you use your computer lot it sort of defeats the purpose of it being wireless the keys are not silent although they are more quiet than most standard keyboards the backlighting provides nice visual but contributes to the poor battery life on single charge however the light level makes the keys very visible in dark or dimly lit room if the rgbs are important to you consider keyboard with more programmability because this one can only switch between off on and glow with options to toggle light level and glow frequency ,106,3.0
positive,overall great keyboard and rechargeable too the computer doesnt give you any warning whatsoever when the battery is low or dead so it might cut out mid use similarly the battery life isn stellar but that to be expected of light up keyboard overall good value at its price point ,50,5.0
neutral,i like the raised keys not using for gaming but for work what dislike is that it doesn have setting for backlight to stay on which is what wanted ,29,5.0
positive,i don use this for gaming and haven used the sleep mode so can really rate it like the way it lights up and it good keyboard only issue is lost the charging cable and can seem to find replacement not even on their website do recommend this though ,49,5.0
neutral,it fairly bright but you re stuck with the one rainbow color pattern and some of the colors are not as bright as others making typing in the dark harder than it should be the keys are raised up and beveled like keyboard from years ago so the striking surface is smaller than on newer keyboards this makes typing and accuracy little slower some of the keys are placed little weird too the key to the left of the enter key usually has the apostrophe and quotation mark this one has the backslash and vertical line as was used to my last keyboard kept putting backslashes where apostrophes should be ll likely be replacing this soon ,116,3.0
positive,fast shipped love it the keyboard works great ,8,1.0

positive,this is fair to middling keyboard the back lighting only works when it is plugged in some folks think the back lighting is just gimmicky bling thing but in darkened room its necessary and if you go cordless no back light would rather have truly cordless model with lots of batteries prefer the heft this one is very light adding to sense of cheapness it is compact still room for improvement will try another when tire of this one still searching for the one would re order this ain it but still reasonable value ,94,5.0

neutral,it doesn have solid lighting doesn match my red themed pc mouse mousepad setup ,14,5.0
positive,great keyboard am able to connect from another room without direct line of sight response time is excellent it does miss key from time to time but attribute that to range and signal penetration and it really not an imposition but best of all the manufacturer is both very responsive and helpful and also have great sense of humor edit spilled little coffee on it today the keyboard immediately spazzed out turned it off took it apart and cleaned and dried all of it still broken suffice it to say waterproof is not what this is ,96,5.0
positive,outstanding product and customer service thanks ,6,3.0
negative,this is an awesome keyboard but what triggered my purchase was that thought it was water proof not sure how got that idea think some reviews had read were making mistake of saying water proof and not water resistant had also read reviews on another site that mentioned silicon sealed internals and the keyboard has quite few holes in it they are very well engineered for liquid to run onto and through the keyboard drying it very quickly have inquisitive pet birds that knock stuff over all the time onto my keyboards and are also fascinatd with stomping around on the keys seems to be weird fascination with most larger birds have seen so the idea of keyboard could just wash in the sink was awesome except that it isn have ran into few other people that have made the same assumption and instant destruction of an awesome keyboard as myself woulodn even really call it water resistant the board the battery wires and well everything is jsimply placed inside with no covering or anything while the drainage heoles do help mitigate spill damage the internal components seem very ill quiped for moisture of any typ my keyboard died quite instantly upon wiping it down with damp rag bit on the wet side though rung out quite bit so be careful this was selling point that somehow got very confusing which failed upon light testing of the water resistance ,239,1.0
neutral,it has been about months and this keyboard completely stopped working this lights are broken they don stay on and the light fr caps lock doesn turn on not to mention it won type whatsoever anymore do not recommend this keyboard ,41,5.0

neutral,product came in good box along with humorous company statement however everything afterwards was dismay the wireless keyboards has lot of lag the simplest way to describe it is pretty decent gamer and getting owned by noobs because of this system don even get me started on just using it for daily mundane tasks check and write emails the system would lag so much that would rather write whole essay in my cellphone and send it that way ,78,5.0
positive,i purchased two of these one works of the time get some ghost keys and missed keys but it is something can live with this second keyboard though wow just wow maybe half the keys work at most charged it up tried multiple computers oses etc same result get maybe half the keys working it is very random too as to when it happens and which keys spend little extra and get something that is actually worth it and if you are worried about accuracy buy wired ,87,5.0
positive,i ve been using mechanical boards for while and randomly used non mechanical one that found in my closet and realized like it way more so went to amazon to find better quality non mechanical board and found the corsair which was but then saw this board for only so tried this one out no complains whatsoever yet typing feels great fast response time very lightweight and wireless has been flawless update been using this now for years still has no issues and works great,85,1.0
positive,honestly couldn be happier with it hadn heard of the company before but the receipt of this keyboard made me an instant fan quality product at fair price and they seem to be sincere in putting customer service first and it came with metal stickers one immediately went on my pc will buy more of their products update after couple of years the charging port broke but the keyboard was still under warranty and they sent me brand new one absolutely wonderful customer service still experience ,86,5.0

positive,stopped working within week had hoped for better ,8,5.0
positive,this keyboard is not silent the keys do click not as loud as the other keyboards ve had but this is why bought it to be soundless know keyboards won be silent but can tell why they put that in their description when it just as loud as other keyboards also when you aren typing and the lights are showing you can hear humming sound coming from the board and it doesn go away until the lights shut off do live the lighted keyboard just wish it bit more quiet ,90,5.0

negative,i was excited to try wireless keyboard and really thought would like this battery life would last about full day and half but it charged fast the lights made it easy to type at night which was also bonus typing with it was sort of annoying noisy but could have forgiven that if the product was actually decent after few weeks the typing just got completely laggy and every few keystrokes missed it became impossible to type on plugging it in with the charge wire didn fix the problem so switched back to my old wired keyboard waste of money for how fast this broke down ,106,5.0
positive,some keyboards have very flat keys and have hard time feeling the keys these are great because the keys are slightly recessed in the middle ,25,5.0
positive,this is such an excellent product it quiet it in no way ever bothers my carpal tunnel and the colors are rich and vibrant the battery charge lasts for quite some time too additionally the customer service is second to none my usb dongle sadly disappeared in move and they replaced it free of charge no less within days of my email to tech support they provided ample instructions on how to sync the new receiver and even included candy in the package as friendly touch cannot brag enough about how great klim is ,94,5.0

positive,this is an amazing keyboard silent keystrokes backlit that isn blinding or distracting super high quality and the best part of all it rechargeable ,24,5.0
positive,so far have been satisfied with the keyboard and would recommend it to others the one issue is the special cord to recharge the keyboard and the ability to match the lighting to my laptop do understand the limits on the battery life that prevent the keyboard from staying active all the time but would like to be able to dim the keyboard when inactive but with the light still bright enough or at least marker key to engage the lights to make it easier to see in the dark it may be little nit picky but the purpose of the lights is to allow me to see and enjoy the back lights while playing and not have to stop and turn on light just to re orient my self to the keys while trying to immerse myself in game ,140,5.0
positive,i buy it again it looks nice and feels nice ,10,2.0

neutral,it is muc more than what expected ,7,4.0
positive,only thing don like about it is that the cable included in the package is only for charging rather than for charging and wired use you must use the wireless adapter for it to work not huge deal but it would be nice if wired use was an option it would make sense ,53,5.0
positive,update changed my review from five stars to stars it stills holds charge but the num lock keeps turning off and when hit it it makes me push the key about four times before it turns on again and now it has huge lag have only had it couple weeks and it is starting to take crap holds charge can shut it off at night and can also plug it in my computer to charge and still use it love it super quiet keys ,84,5.0

neutral,bought this around months ago the advertised range of feet is just not true have the dongle around feet away and the keyboard randomly stops registering keystrokes have to bring the keyboard close to the dongle for it to re register and then sit back down on the couch this might be battery related but then there is no visual indicator of battery levels today though it just completely stopped working doesnt register any keystrokes the keyboard is very light which is nice ,83,4.0

positive,i bought this for the office to have as something different love that the keyboard and mouse are rechargable totally what sold me on it but would be nice the lights would stay on longer before timing out and if there were more options for the light like maybe blinking or running back and forth or even blink multi color or even different solid colors to pick from along with the different light options blink flash fade etc other than that overall good product thank you,86,5.0

positive,it is lite weight works well so far but only have it for week will post back in month have been using it for about weeks need to charge it every days that is bit faster then would like the reason dropped this from five stars to fours stars is it dies boom good then bad when it needs the charge don like to be surprised by working keyboard then dead one without warning when it works like it like the feel and find it nice for blogging but could be writing here then dead almost instantly this means have to keep track of when to charge it have to work bit extra to not get caught off guard will come back and review it in six months hope the battery keeps taking charge am thinking this was not my best choice use it hours day not typing constantly but still hitting the keys fairly often it is lit night to day and the charge runs down fairly quickly wish it had larger battery my fear is it will not take charge after six months use if you are going to type lot and constantly don buy this ,198,4.0

positive,i got this because love playing different games ranging from first person shooters to indie singleplayer story games it works for everything if it does happen to run out of battery then you can easily plug it in and keep doing whatever you like ,44,2.0
negative,i was really interested in this because it markets itself as quiet and let me tell you if never needed to use the space bar it would be very very quiet however as most modern languages call for spaces between words this keyboard is incredibly loud if you so much as look at the space bar it clacks it probably the only thing you can hear from my desk as every other key is so silent the space bar ruins the rest of the key board no connectivity issues the time out is fine battery is fine keys work great but gosh darn is it loud don know if it going to stop bothering me at some point trying to give it time but may have to just scrap this keyboard and try different brand say spend your money elsewhere as this is beyond annoying ,145,1.0
positive,i purchased this keyboard for use with my gaming machine using it upon my lap in chair with arm rests it doesn fit within the boundaries of the arm rests which causes me to be partially rotated to the left to even try and use it wish the keys were more centrally located for my back sake great backlight which dealuminates after use keys are bit clunky an overreach for that satisfying tactile response producing labored finger extension while using wish they would send me one without the number pad as not to interrupt the use of my main machine which use hours every day ,105,5.0
positive,awesome keyboard for gaming at this price,7,1.0
positive,have had this key board for about month now and only had to charge it one time after the initial charge while having the pulsing effect on although do not type long messages out like this all day long do use the key board pretty frequently switches feel extremely smooth as well will update again for its use in the long term ,62,5.0

neutral,for computer use into the evening hours very nice and functional to have lighted keyboard ,15,5.0
positive,had it for week and it was great until it started just randomly inputting keys and became unusable do not buy ,21,5.0
neutral,some standard hotkeys don work with the left shift button disappointed but want to like this keyboard the company refunded me then ordered another one cause it neat keyboard and hoped the problem was fluke nope same problem on the second one specifically ctrl left shift any of the following u m do not work on this keyboard if you normally use ctrl right shift any key suppose you won notice problem but for me first noticed it trying to select inverse in photoshop ctrl shift and found the other problems using keyboard ghosting tool aside from that problem like this keyboard but it really touts anti ghosting stuff so did not expect this kind of problem it might not seem like big deal but it easier for me to just use different keyboard than re learn decades old muscle memory and who knows what other key combinations are faulty ,150,5.0
positive,that is perfect thank you ,5,5.0
negative,i purchased this item because of the backlighting planned to use it in our living room at night to interact with our tv the backlighting is great like the feel of the keyboard but yesterday connected it to my desktop was having problems when would hit the return key with my left pinky after comparing the klim with the worn out logitech am replacing found that there is an extra key between the quotation mark key and the enter key the backslash key has been moved down row if were hunt and peck typist suppose this would be fine but learned to touch type years ago use my touch typing skills many times day why would want to teach myself how to find the enter key all over again to press key thinking that am using the enter key and then finding that have backslash or that the item failed to load is maddening dislike giving low score to such good looking keyboard but if buyers have the same concern as do they need to know what they are buying would also prefer larger delete key ,186,5.0
neutral,this was great buy but reason gave it stars is it doesn have very long range to operate in you can only go about feet before you lose connection ,29,5.0

positive,the keyboard looks and works great ,6,4.0
negative,this keyboard is deceptive it really pretty and feels good to use but in about months of use it started having response issues use it for gaming and it would randomly stop responding or lag for few seconds to minutes before recovering it does this regardless of charger status and even when plugged in used it directly next to the receiver and on different machines so it isn the bluetooth on my end or distance affecting it think either the keys lose responsivity or the bluetooth signal is losing connection ,90,5.0
positive,i love the back lighting rechargeable battery and light personally only sit at desk when playing games mostly like wireless so don have to sit at flat surface for the keyboard use like to sit back from my computer on inch monitor tv for emails you tube videos and browsing the internet while holding the keyboard only when changing websites your design makes that harder to pick up or hold with the left hand and typing with the right the keys go to the very edge of the unit only the bottom and right top corner have spot to use thumb to hold without touching key little more area on right side would be ideal for many users comfort when holding the board especially near the esc key an another model perhaps flared out going to the top ,138,5.0

positive,it not mine but my son got it for christmas and he really likes it over the xbox controller ,19,5.0
positive,i have been using this keyboard for about or days now and so far it works really well for it intended purpose love the way that the keys feel and that the lights look when am typing that being said there are few things that knocked this keyboard down to only stars the first is that while the keyboard is advertised as being silent this is not the case in fact have found that some of the keys that are more commonly used such as the enter key or the spacebar are actually louder than the rest of the keys for me this hasn been huge deal but can see how people would be upset if they bought it with the intention of having quiet keyboard the second thing is that the led lights are not as bright as would have wanted in the dark they stand out perfectly and look amazing however in daytime or brighter lighting the lights are hard to see and draw away from the overall aesthetic of the keyboard ,174,4.0
positive,it fast and comfortable to use,6,5.0
positive,battery life is great great beginner keyboard,7,5.0
positive,nice keyboard at this price just make sure your computer is bluetooth compatible for wireless operation ,16,5.0
positive,easy to use great to go wireless ,7,2.0
positive,i have been using this keyboard for almost and half months and at first issues with finding the on off switch for turning on wireless and had to have both plugged into my computer for wireless and charging after found the switch on the back it made everything easier and more convenient would recommend this to anyone looking for good wireless keyboard with long battery life ,66,5.0
negative, big design problems the lights don stay on probably to conserve the battery this means if you are not using the keyboard for few seconds say you are just using the mouse or just reading the screen the keys go dark then you can see whatever key you need to hit first when you are ready the enter key is one key farther to the right than standard keyboard as life long touch typist now am tying when mean to hit enter so not only did not gain the ability to see the keys in the dark but lost the expected location of the enter key just couple of points of clarification you cannot change the colors you can just adjust the brightness of the backlighting and you can put it on some weird breath setting where it slowly goes brigher and darker this does not take batteries like most wireless keyboards it actually requires wire to charge the built in battery which is billed as taking hours to charge for hours of usage might as well leave it connected so much for wireless ,184,1.0
positive,grandson loves it it is awesome love the colors not to bright ,12,5.0
positive,works great great value for the money ,7,4.0
positive,i got this as gift for my husband for christmas and couldn be happier for this has good set of lights and it comes with built in battery that charges via usb my husband loves it and at it was steal and customer for life now the only minor thing about this is that it sleeps little too fast but any key waking it up makes that almost null ,69,1.0
neutral,this was purchased for pc that occasionally gets used for gaming but nothing intensive on the like side is the backlit keys which are multi colored and bright and readable when all other lights are out in the room something have struggled to find in other purchased keyboards second is the sleep mode which immediately responds when key is depressed bringing the keyboard back to life and recording the initial keystroke to the screen have mid high corsair that cannot do that at times the price tag and battery life is way longer than the more expensive corsair my only dislike is the change the manufacturer made in the enter return key all of my other keyboards without exception have horizontal return key this one has moved the key with the forward slash mark to the row next to the quotation marks key allowing the return key to be vertical rather than horizontal for touch key typist this creates problem since the pinky finger now has an additional full key width space to cross to get the return key it did not have with other keyboards for gamers this is an acceptable inexpensive keyboard and well worth the money for touch typist you might want to pick something else as the change in the return key is very frustrating this is an update from original initial review device did not last year and stopped working altogether as did the expensive corsair have gone back to good wired keyboard ,248,4.0

positive,if you re touch typist expect to be slowed down and make lot of mistakes because the enter key is much further to the right than any other keyboard ve ever used because of this this keyboard is very uncomfortable to use the keys resist bit but bounce back slowly it very easy for fast typist to get letters out of order because they keyboard just isn responsive enough don see how anyone would accept this as gaming keyboard ,79,5.0

neutral,it already does not work had to buy another keyboard color not very bright ,14,2.0
negative,less than months after receiving my keyboard it stopped working the on off switch on the back of the keyboard seems to have something to do with the problem the keyboard stopped working couple of weeks after the return window closed so was referred to klim directly long story short klim never resolved the issue despite the fact that this product has warranty sent about emails before giving up would definitely not recommend the product when purchased the keyboard was excited about the features described but if the product doesn function then those features are useless note didn have any problems with the amazon seller ,105,2.0

positive,love it use it for work in darker room ,9,2.0
positive,update reorganized the living room and it seems that the wireless signal improved lot corners seem problematic for the dongle with good direct line of sight it works well really like the look and the fact that the enter key is large iso layout the key between and left shift is missing tho not sure whether it should be there anyway packing is nice and adds emotional value the usb charging cable is little too short the bad news is if it is not close enough to the dongle it fails lot after it goes to sleep it sometimes wakes up unresponsive you get key double presses and lost keystrokes randomly copying pasting and cutting can be chore because you don know if the keyboard sent the ctrl or ctrl appropriately if you figure out how to keep steady link between the keyboard and transmitter you re all good wish there was way to know how much battery is left if you re ok spending more on keyboard go for the pro stuff if you re on budget it good pick dear klim guys like you try improving connectivity for solid reliable wireless performance and showing battery usage,198,5.0

neutral,on time delivery and nice quality,6,5.0
neutral,the keyboard itself as keyboard works fine however there are few things that need improvement the backlight needs to be brighter and the individual keys need to stay lite up even when the backlight fades out need to give the user the option to select to keep the back light on constantly instead of just fading or off user that likes the back light to stay on not fan of the fading in out as it makes it hard to see the keys in the dark especially if trying to find numbers and symbols the enter key is too far to the right for comfortable typing selection meaning that the enter key should be where the key is normal keyboards have the enter key closer in this position so when typing we easily select the right key but you have the key where the enter key should be so it interferes and causes us to hit the wrong key the keyboard isn that quiet hitting the keys when typing softly the keys still make lot of noise ,177,4.0
positive,it an ok product for the most part there are few things that noticed that lead me to give this product only stars the sleep time on the led feature is too short and not adjustable it turns off the led lights after about seconds and if you re trying to use it in the dark this defeats the purpose of getting an illuminated keyboard there should be an ability to leave it on the brightness on the led lights is not very good in completely dark room it may be passable but in room with partial illumination like lamp or even the light from your tv monitor screen the keys get little lost and not easy to see since they blend with the glare from the screen the chroma colors make such dimly lit product that much harder to see and you can adjust this it would be better if you could make it just green white or blue lights but the chroma color runs across the keyboard and the red color is very dim to top it off the leds are so far under the keys that you get more of halo effect around the underside of the key than lighting up the key characters themselves the only pros have about this product are the price cheap for what it is the quiet no click of the keys perfect if someone else is in the room trying to sleep usb charger compatible aside from the things mentioned at the top of this post there are some extras that could have made this product better dedicated buttons for ff rev play pause vol up down mute having to constantly press function button for basic features like those when you want to control music or volume is annoying removable rechargeable batteries you can replace and charge in the unit when the charger is plugged in had mouse that did this and it was great feature and when the battery could no longer hold charge just replaced it the ghz dongle is awesome but also having bluetooth option can make this better and able to connect to devices that don have usb ports but keep the dongle not happy with mine will return it and spend little more on better solution for me ,382,5.0

positive,i got this for gaming on my xbox one plugged in the usb adapter and that it it works great great price for great product and would purchase again great battery life also,33,5.0
positive,this keyboard is extremely comfortable to type on and the backlight makes it possible to type with the lights off ,20,1.0
positive,i needed new keyboard for my ps pro and this is the best one ve had so far it not as compact as the mini keyboards ve been using but this one works very well so far ,37,5.0
positive,great keyboard for everyday use led nice brite only wish it would stay on longer or on all the time otherwise great keyboard,23,4.0
positive,love the lights and it is quite love the charge time and how long it stays charged great keyboard all around easy to use and set up ,27,4.0
negative,this keyboard is thoroughly average you press keys and the computer reacts there are no glitches the backlight turns on so you can see the keys in the dark as advertised unless it goes to sleep there is nothing to set this keyboard apart in fact it is lacking in some ways for example there is no way to determine how much batter power you have left which is inexcusable for wireless gaming input device there is nothing worse than discovering your keyboard is dead in the middle of gaming session they did not even need to write software to display this information windows can display it if the device simply provides it am also not fan of the key layout they got creative with the placement of the backslash key instead of being in its normal position above the enter key they pushed the quote key to the left and jammed backslash in between that and enter enter has been stretched up to backspace the end result is that if you try to type backslash or pipe characters say when entering paths or escape characters or coding you wind up hitting the enter key instead possibly times since you re typing without looking on instinct don know how many times have tried to type in path an inadvertently submitted the wrong path to the os by pressing enter instead of backslash very frustrating the quote key being shifted to the left is also very annoying but not quite as bad if you are developer this keyboard will slow you down for this reason alone particularly if you then go to work and use keyboards with standard layout maybe others are different but the absolute last thing want in keyboard is less than standard key layout it renders useless years of accumulated intuition and experience ,305,3.0
neutral,the keys are very buggy in response takes hitting the keys several times in some instances for them to work keyboard goes into sleep mode seconds after you hit key so it is constantly turning off forcing you to jam the keys to get them to work again it is pretty and the company sends you cute emails after you buy it but just garbage product overall have had to buy new keyboard just days after purchasing this one as it id border line unusable,85,5.0
neutral,it looks good and like the lighted keys when need to use my computer at night for short time no longer have to turn on the light ,27,1.0
positive,i use this keyboard for my ps as play mostly at night and needed quieter way to play online with people this does just the trick and is just more comfortable and quicker for me to type on than those tiny keyboard attachments for controllers my only small complaint as others have mentioned is some colored keys are easier to see than others but overall it hasn been significant issue and serves its purpose ,74,5.0
positive,solid keyboard lighting is bit dim and the timeout is definitely too short as it goes dark too quickly other than those issues it works perfectly and the battery life has been more than adequate ,35,2.0
positive,the keys are very quiet and the led add nice touch to the office however for typing occasionally do look at the keyboard to ensure of my hand placement is correct or to look at the key pad to punch numbers the downside is that the keys are pretty dark themselves so tough to see at glance overall happy with my purchase ,62,4.0
neutral,it was present,3,2.0
positive,i think you guys did very good job of building this keyboard it really matches my computer tower have at home keep up the good work ,26,4.0

positive,exactly what needed in wireless keyboard for using with ps works great ,12,5.0
neutral,works great adjustable lighting stays charged for long time no chord in the way smooth keys light weight only small complaints when it is in sleep mode whatever key you hit to wake it actually works therefore you have possibly typed wrong key when using password to open something also you can pick one solid color again nothing major would buy another one or recommend it ,66,4.0
positive,the back lights are not as bright as wanted them to be work in the dark really wanted to see it glow while was working the keyboard it self is perfect size for me the charging light never comes on but that is ok over all would buy another one for my home location,54,1.0
positive,i got this for my ps pro works great love the colors too make time to read the second half of their email it hilarious please don ask me technical questions had my dad install it and my techie brother got it working along with mouse ,46,3.0
positive,it cool wish it was bit brighter and wish the keyboard stayed lit when you aren typing ,17,5.0
positive, great easy to use ,4,1.0
positive,as far as gaming is concerned not using it for that using it because have diabetic retinopathy and it helps with seeing the keys the brightness is perfect the battery life have not ran into problem have used it when my computer is docked and several days have gone by without charging it again so to me that great ,59,5.0
positive,updated used to be stars now find the lighted keyboard distracting but when turn the light off can see the characters on the keys had to buy stickers for the keys so could use the keyboard without the light on this hopefully will help my second issue which is having to recharge the thing when it starts misbehaving wireless ought to mean no need for wires would prefer batteries easier to replace batteries every couple of months than to recharge every week otherwise the keyboard is fine update the mouse in this combo became laggy after about month taking second or two to respond when used it that lag has increased to the point that today am still waiting for my cursor to respond an hour after booting up new battery made no difference useless ordering different brand today ,139,5.0
neutral,otherwise it seemed to work fine ,6,5.0
positive,everything is great except the enter key ,7,5.0
neutral,letters needs to be bolder not bright enough,8,5.0
neutral,it would be better if you had setting that made the lights stay on all the time,17,5.0
positive,when turned it on and the back lights appeared in beautiful rainbow pattern was blown away it is such nice keyboard am definitely impressed with this product upon first receipt what love best about the product is everything really the keys are soft and comfortable with the exception of the space key love how quiet these keys are can type discreetly without being too loud love that the lighting is adjustable both in pattern and brightness the breathing mode is very neat feature and like that can adjust the speed of it it has calming effect but also like that can keep the lights on all the time or even turn them off completely if don want them on the wireless feature is neat because can take it anywhere and position it anywhere and don have to worry about plugging it in like the little legs on the bottom so can raise the keyboard up or leave it flat if want it to be more or less ergonomic the battery display is great feature because can tell when need to plug it in before it loses power also like that the dongle that plugs into the computer has little nook on the back of the keyboard so they can stay together when not in use on the instructions pamphlet at the very end it says thinks for reading it should say thanks for reading it obvious that great care was taken to create high quality product so it disappointing to see such careless error one other thing don care for is how loud the space bar is all the rest of the keys are soft and hardly make sound but when tap the space bar it makes loud plastic sound that seems to resonate throughout the room for how often it gets used was hoping it would be bit quieter other than those two things wouldn change anything this product is very easy to use the instructions were incredibly helpful and well written it nice to see the instructions written out in so many languages it gives the impression that this is worldwide company and because of that very successful it gives the company lot of credibility the instructions were easy to read and follow like that the function keys are explained and there is even an illustration of the keyboard with keys labelled so they are easy to find on the real keyboard absolutely love this keyboard and would recommend it to all of my friends whether you have laptop or desktop computer this keyboard is not only great to look at it works very well there is an incredible value for the money here have several klim products in my office and love each one am satisfied with this company and will definitely purchase products from them again ,470,5.0
neutral,i bought this specifically because it said it was quiet keyboard not even close it is no more quiet than normal keyboard false advertising and false description of the product have quiet hp keyboard and thought this one would be like that one because of the description this one went back in the box and ordered another hp wireless elite keyboard wish had just ordered another hp in the first place but got fooled by the false description in the headline of this keyboard ,84,4.0
positive,this keyboard is satisfying purchase it checks all the right boxes and is great for gaming work and everyrthing in between ,21,5.0
negative,i have to change my review from star to star had surgery couple weeks ago so my keyboard sat unused for weeks and getting back to it it only works about half the time it either won type anything at all or it types the wrong thing nothing was spilled on it it is dust free undamaged etc now realize the lighting up underneath is hampering problem instead of good thing because if all it did was light up under the keys that would be fine but without the keys having painted on white letters they re virtually impossible to see and that pain in the ass wanted to return the keyboard for refund so could get different one but apparently passed that window while was recovering from surgery also have asked questions of the seller but they have yet to be answered so my original star review has now dropped to star and if this continues over the next week ll leave worse review and drop it to star for customer service alone paid for product and expect it to work and if it not going to work expect to be able to get my money back so can find product that does work am an author and gamer and this has really messed up both aspects ,218,4.0
neutral,product is as described pleased with my purchase ,8,5.0
positive,letters are small and faint even with the back lighting perhaps there is way to increase the brightness,18,5.0
positive,i like to keep office lights turned down depending on task at hand and appreciate the illuminated keys this is just for my personal office use would actually prefer the option to use battery power but charging by usb now and then is fine personally was looking for keyboard with larger letters as my eyesight has gotten worse but sny option saw was wired not offered as wireless would also have preferred all one color but for my personal use this is rather pretty ,84,5.0
neutral,if you type too fast certain keys will not register,10,1.0
positive,really great keyboard gamer and have had zero issues it has quick response time can tell the difference between this and my wired razor black widow keyboard my only feedback for the company would be to provide some sort of indication software or hardware based of how much battery life there is ,52,2.0
positive,i am not gamer but love the keyboards that light up and change color finally needed new keyboard for work so ordered this one since it was such great price and am not fancy keyboard person curved piece etc and love this keyboard am probably going to buy second one for home this is perfect for me super happy with my purchase and super fast shipping stars plus ,68,5.0

positive,really nice keyboard its far quiet than mechanical keyboard which is what want the finger resist is slightly higher but its fine battery lasts me about week on full brightness there is not many cons so am nick picking but every time you turn off the keyboard it forgets your settings and the actual placing of the off button is unusual so just always leave it on now its really just to stop the cat walking on it anyways highly recommend it espcially if your computer doesnt have bluetooth,89,5.0

neutral,nice keyboard with few quirks ,5,5.0
neutral,it great silent but deadly ,5,5.0
positive,really cool keyboard the rainbow lights look awesome like that they turn off on automatically while in use to avoid draining battery faster can speak to how long it stays charged or with what kind of use my keyboard use can be pretty sporadic as it just for personal use and not heavy gaming or regular work use the charging cable is short for my liking prefer to plug it into an adapter and not the computer for efficient charging the feel of the keys is nice they press easily but not too easily typing is quiet the keyboard is very lightweight which is nice for someone like me who moves it to charge it and also put it away when not in use it also fairly compact for full keyboard so it nice it doesn take up much space ,140,5.0

positive,this keyboard is great was using it so quickly just plugged in the usb dongle and it was ready to go the lights are so pretty and the board is so lightweight this is easily transportable it has switch which allows you to shut of the lights if you choose my daughter was so excited when she realized that besides the pc she could also use on her xbox it would actually be great if this could come with multiple dongles so it could be used on more than device at time however it so easy to switch that it really not such big deal to do it yourself it charges really easily too for the price this is good buy ,121,5.0
positive,to me personally this item looks so however bought it for friend and she says it works perfectly and makes her desk area look alive ,25,5.0
neutral,because the keylighting was not distinctive enough and because the time out was too fast for our preference it did not meet our needs ,24,5.0
neutral,can see the letters on the keys lights don add any benefit return key is farther away than on most keyboards so end up hitting the key instead very bad choice on my part ,34,5.0
positive,product is great and works well,6,5.0
neutral,there placement of backslash next to the enter key throws me off and keep hitting that key ,17,1.0
positive,rgb is good with on off and breathing very small and light keys are close together and not too loud main thing is it doesn hold charge for long if you game lot this keyboard only lasts not even days no warning just shuts off at the perfect time ,49,5.0
positive,this is neat keyboard it smaller than my old wired one but that perfect it light weight and holds charge ve been using it for about week and have only charged it twice it hasn gone dead on me so not sure how long it lasts with full charge just need to make sure it doesn during gaming the lights turn off after few seconds of non use but sure that to save battery the colors are neat have lighted mouse pad that lights up with the same colors and it looks pretty cool all in all happy with this keyboard so far ,103,5.0

neutral,if you have intent on using this for anything other than typing good luck the keys are weirdly spaced it membrane and not mechanical and the position for some of the outer function keys are weird ,36,5.0
neutral,used for xbox one,4,5.0
neutral,the product is not worth the price because the keys are too big the lights are dimmed and it felt poorly made in general although it worked correctly would spend money elsewhere,32,5.0
positive,i ordered this after my very old hp wireless keyboard decided to tap out on me with few of the keys just no longer working at all since my family member didn want to spend the on can of compressed air to fix it so tried few ways to see if it could be fixed trying few other tips on my own as it was bit grimy dirty but unfortunately for whatever reason the keys still wouldn work so figured why not purchase brand new one after searching on amazon my eyes were immediately drawn to this one to be honest so far am really liking this keyboard especially the colored lighting when it hits nighttime talk about really nifty idea so far love it the one downside have with this keyboard though is the fact that it has to be charged using charger to connectto my wireless pc when needed unfortunately need to disconnect my separate wireless mouseconnector in order to charge up the battery for the keyboard as my pc only has usb ports on the left side from what can tell as don know if it might have few more usb ports in the very back which is bit of possible small letdown but am sure ll get used to it overtime with that said it arrived in timely quick manner am super excited to begin using it gonna hope that itwill last as long as it does ,241,5.0

neutral,very efficient,2,5.0
negative,the fact that you can keep the lights always on totally defeats the purpose of buying this product for gaming and night time using the lights turn off too fast if you are not constantly typing something even at their longest settings and you can select just one of the five colors of the leds so you are stuck with the rainbow lights also it not that very quiet compared to an old mechanical keyboard have it only about quieter hate the fact that thought was buying an american product because of the american flag on their main advertising image on it front page but it made in china ,109,5.0
neutral,i charged it once few months ago still waiting for the battery to die and it get used pretty regularly nice thing is that it only uses battery when it in use ,32,4.0

positive,i have to admit that am extremely pleased with this keyboard do game from time to time and it has performed exactly as expected mainly got the keyboard for coding though and it is the main reason now stay up much later at night to get the job done it is without doubt the best keyboard have ever owned the backlighting is superb and have yet to experience any strain from typing for prolonged periods of time it is very lightweight and robust and has already survived few water spills if you have kids rest assured that the keyboard can survive even their attention in nutshell then it is way better than expected for the price ,116,5.0
neutral,changed the batteries out twice the keyboard must be plugged in to work once you unplug it from the wall it dies ,22,1.0
negative,garbage colors on keyboard go in and out and if you don touch keyboard for seconds it goes completely black waste of money cant see the keys when am gaming at night terrible one star for usability ,37,5.0
positive,i was desperately in need of new keyboard and thought might as well upgrade to wireless board and mouse combo for the price and shipping speed was very excited for this product however it would not connect for longer than just few keystrokes then it would be unresponsive until left it alone for few minutes then could type another characters before starting the process over again promptly returned it and really like my new setup granted had to wait little longer will say this keyboard had great feel and excellent footprint for smaller desk it seemed fairly easy to be able to carry around with laptop although not recommended ,109,3.0
positive,the bluetooth receiver works well can put it in the back of my computer and not have an issue with connection much quieter than my previous click clack old keyboard but it not silent it gets louder the more quickly you type as well but if you take your time it can be decently quiet no extra buttons need to press fn to use the secondary key commands but works well for my purposes just leave the lights on unless guests come over lol ,84,4.0
positive,i bought this to replace logitech wireless keyboard used to control my htpc from the couch about feet away the logitech was not lighted and the signal was not very good from that distance this klim keyboard has completely reliable wireless connection and hasn missed keystroke yet and love being able to see the lighted keys at night the battery is pretty decent as well lasting around days before need to charge it again with heavy use it comes with usb charge cable that you just plug into any usb charger or pc usb port to charge the built in battery the only slight negative is the layout is iso vs ansi and takes bit to get used to overall highly recommend this keyboard ,124,2.0
positive,typing speed increased makes me happy was struggling with logitech keyboard that held me back from typing my usual wpm very happy with this klim chroma keyboard ,27,3.0

positive,i bought this to replace my office keyboard and love it the rainbow back light make me so happy ve had many comments on how nice it is it is responsive and attractive ,33,3.0
positive,the klim keyboard had good reviews so thought give it shot glad did ve been looking for deal on backlit keyboard but everything found was plus for gaming board really like this for the smaller frame yet having key included the multicolor backlighting is nice although the colors are fixed and only allow adjustment for pulse on or off and dimming don use keyboard for gaming much so really can comment on that the bottom line is if you are looking for an inexpensive keyboard that looks good has backlighting decent battery life and has smaller footprint for full size board then this is it ,105,3.0
positive,i love the look of this and the quality is great ,11,5.0
positive,i bought the keyboard for my boyfriend it awesome great to use in the dark although when the lights are pulsating the keyboard does make ringing sound other than that it was really easy for him to adjust from his old keyboard to this one and we ve charged it once for like minutes and it been working for days of use so the battery life is great definitely nice product,71,5.0
neutral,not enough lighting modes effects,5,5.0
positive,i originally ordered this keyboard just over years ago and was and still am very happy with the product the product is lightweight the keys feel nice and they are pretty quiet like that it has the separate number pad but the whole keyboard is not too large or bulky the rechargeable battery lasted longer than expected so was able to take advantage of the wireless feature when the battery does die you can still use the keyboard while it is plugged in and charging and the battery light on the top right corner turns off when its charged the rainbow colour lights behind the keys are nice touch too am not gamer though so have no comment on its features for that purpose just recently the battery started to die more frequently and had to plug it in more often which was not the end of the world for me as most keyboards require cords anyway however the battery eventually started to expand and the keyboard warped and became unusable went back to my amazon order and checked to see if there was warranty and there was years reached out to customer service via email with pictures of the keyboard and my original invoice they responded within the same day and offered me replacement have the replacement now and still love it the company has provided exceptional customer service they were very responsive and they stand behind their product they even checked in with me to make sure that received the replacement and that it was working as expected ,260,4.0
neutral,i professional who writes lot and thought on giving this low budget keyboard try it is not suitable for heavy writing work as it becomes really heavy on the hands after few thousand words it is however well designed keyboard that can be used for simple daily computing ,48,5.0
positive,i use this keyboard for gaming great product and good customer service as well ,14,5.0
negative,very disappointed with this keyboard do lot of office work and the ctrl shift doesn work on the left side of the keyboard did little research and it appears this is common issue you have to use ctrl shift on the right side which is so awkward will be returning this keyboard as am not happy with it on side note it is very quiet when type but the spacebar is much louder than the other keys ,77,5.0
positive,considering it keyboard and the title indicates long lasting rechargeable battery you expect the charge to last little longer the fancy glow lights obviously drain it faster than you expect it gives you no warning when the charge is low just quits and you have to plug it in otherwise it is keyboard the lights are cool bought this for the cordless factor after it charged but it the star feeling not bad not great it fine ,77,1.0
neutral,it isn waterproof it just false sense of security went awhile without spilling anything on it and just last week spilled water on it turned it off right away kept it off till it dried up and it completely done bought water proof keyboard cuz it supposed to be water proof ,51,1.0
negative,i dont usually give feedback but this one has to be my worst purchase in long time despite of all the positive reviews got my keyboard in november many times have got letters being typed double few days ago the keyboard just stopped working no more lights no more signal and no more life that keyboard went straight to the trash can ,62,1.0
positive,awesome keyboard the lights are amazing and the keys feel great when typing ,13,1.0
negative,i loved this keyboard for the months it worked then all of sudden the keys either lagged or didn register the click at all then came the connectivity issues it would not work at all even though the usb was plugged in and it was charged would have to troubleshoot for an hour and only sometimes it would work again other times just gave up now after having it for months decided to see if could get it to work again after storing it for about month it does not even register that it is charging so she dead dead very upset with this product ,105,2.0
neutral,my laptop has keys that don work so tried to reset it and sign back in the keys still didn work so ordered this key board and got it day later charged it by port cord which didn know was supplied plugged the usb in and didn need to install anything it just worked ,54,5.0
positive,this is very nice keyboard and of good quality there was no issue getting my pc to recognize it once plugged in the usb adapter one annoying thing about the keyboard is that the background light turns off after about seconds get that this is probably to preserve battery life but in dark environment such at nighttime or for gaming it hard to find the characters on the keyboard when the background light is turned off it would have been nice if there was an option to leave the background lights on while the computer is on or have them turn off after seconds of inactivity would have given this keyboard much higher rating if it weren for this ,119,1.0
neutral,after months of use keys p n have died did not spill any water onto it and was used somewhat frequently for programming guess that is expected due to the cheap price point but was hoping it lasted at least bit longer ,42,5.0
positive,got it for family member they have been very happy with the keyboard battery life could last longer but is still good for night of gaming keyboard works while charging if you need to play for the full day and the on off switch really helps save power when you take break one problem to not is that keyboard remains on while changing even if you switch it off this is minor problem but could be larger issues for others ,80,1.0
positive,they were very responsive and were able to help me as needed thanks ,13,5.0

negative,the headphones themselves are okay but the microphone is horrible it not flexible or adjustable in any way so you can actually get close enough to it to sound better than muffled to anyone else in voice chat it sounds like you re speaking through wad of cotton or from another room have no idea how this has gotten so many five star reviews when the microphone is so so bad ,71,1.0

positive,great price onlycomplaint is cord gets tangled lot,8,5.0
neutral,i was enjoying these headphones although they had some odd features like the dual cable that is excessively long the sound quality was pretty great for the price while it lasted but they made odd cracks and pops from time to time maybe from whatever issue caused them to stop working either way am not impressed and even if were to get another pair of headphones from this brand would not try anymore at this price point ,77,1.0
negative,microphone is bad build quality is horrible feels very cheap like you could purchase at below ,16,5.0

neutral,after two months had lost my mic and now the wire has become disconnected from the headset did say just two months couldn believe it because they had decent reviews ,30,5.0
neutral,the sound quality both playback and recording is fine however find the earmuff portion of the headset to be bit too small as it does not fit around my entire ear and don have particularly large ears afaik this probably wouldn be huge issue for most people but if you have earrings it might be bit uncomfortable ,57,1.0
neutral,had an issue they sent me the wrong color first time as well as faulty headset that had audio issues they promptly handled the issue and have to say for the price point it good headset,36,1.0
negative,this product has been advertised as having led capability and it does but the lights are not bright enough that was the whole entire purpose of what had purchased this set for disappointing and considering beginning return plus the led lights engineered into this unity are barely colored purple and that is what classify as entirely weak kneed lackadaisical engineering prowess disappointing ,62,1.0
positive,this is perfect for kids just getting into gaming that aren yet mature enough to be gentle on very expensive gaming headset would purchase again ,25,2.0
neutral,broke so fast made out of plastic if you dropped it on your bed it could ve broke it antique at this point do not buy this please at all costs ,31,1.0
neutral,the cord is way too long it and it gets tangled up because it is so long and sometimes it cuts out so can only hear in one ear and have to fiddle with the cord to try and fix it the mic cancels most noise but the headset does not cancel any noise and since have fan on can hear it with my headset on and it gets annoying while trying to game ,74,3.0

neutral,it is very good in sound quality noise cancellation,9,2.0
neutral,this does not work with my ps will be returning ,10,5.0
negative,this product is very disappointing and the advertising for it is suspect while it states that it is compatible with the nintendo switch and box one systems the microphone is not compatible with either unless you pay and extra for an adapter to make the microphone work the worst thing though is the return window you have like weeks to return it then you are stuck with it spent two weeks trying to get it to work and figuring out whether it was worth it to pay for the adapter now am stuck with these useless things very very disappointing it is definitely worth it to pay more money for better product that is actually compatible with the systems it says it is compatible with ,125,1.0
positive,so the sound quality is pretty great but the mic seems to be picking up voices from the games play have to lower the dialogue volume if that is an option if not have to turn down the whole game volume to get the mic to not pick it up through the headphones perhaps if the mic was further away from the headphones but because it is so short it seems to pick up voices from games or videos really easily edit so the mute toggle on the cord does not prevent this audio pickup from the mic it completely stops my voice and sounds from my environment but it somehow is still picking up voices from games or videos even when the mute toggle is on ,127,1.0
neutral,i turn it up to max and it just not loud enough for me do however like the flowing pink on the sides ,23,1.0
neutral,these were really nice in the beginning don use my headset often for personal reasons somehow this magically has short in it the sound was never that great and always static like anyway ,33,2.0

neutral,mic stopped working after use bought it in advance for birthday and can return it fun ,16,1.0
negative,overall underwhelming headset given it cheap price sure it could meet your needs don like that the ear muffs don turn so its kind of uncomfortable to wear can imagine wearing these for long periods of time the chord connector is obnoxiously long unless this is something you re looking for mic settings mute is all basic controls which is expected with lower price point mic overall not practical for long term use in my opinion will be returning ,79,5.0
neutral,my son said they worked well for couple of hours then they stopped working no sound couldnt talk ,18,1.0
neutral, ,0,3.0
positive,my little brother got these for his birthday and absolutely loves them he takes em with him everywhere lol haven actually played with em but the one time had them on they seemed pretty comfortable as for noise canceling the boy can hear damn thing when he playing his games so be willing to wager they do good job at that ,61,1.0

neutral,i disliked everything about he headset,6,3.0
positive,the noise cancellation is great had these headphones for little over year before my dog thought it be cute to chew through the extra thick braiding on the cord would recommend trying these if you re on budget ,38,5.0
neutral,the controller needs to be close to the ps because of the short length of the cable can even adjust the length of it sos have to play extremely close to the tv and ps and it uncomfortable to hold ,40,5.0
negative,these headphones are nice to look at but the microphone sucks most gamers of any level or even someone who needs to use it for zoom conferences needs decent quality mic this is not that the positive reviews must only be focused on the sound and the look just got these couple hours ago and will be returning smh,59,1.0
positive,these lasted just long enough for the return window to close the sound quality and everything about them were actually great while it lasted the first thing to go was the mic guessing it was fine at first then my teammates started to say hey your mic is garbage it sounds terrible mute your mic then after the mic started going the end of the plug is now slipping out of the jack all the time and the sound from the speakers almost is starting to sound clipping if these lasted year or so would say great buy but they didn they lasted like month or less ,107,4.0

neutral,in this price range these headphones are top notch replaced my former pair same brand with these and have no complaints ,21,1.0
positive,what liked about the headphones is they are good for my games if there is bass or low tones the headphones feel like they shake bit however the headphones are only ok when cancelling noise can still hear some vehicles drive by outside it is my own fault for not reading the description carefully but what do not like about the headphones is that they need usb attachment and you have to plug it in for the lights the usb thats attached to it as cord is really short but over all like them,94,1.0
positive,great price they work just fine they fit well am not picky person so thought they were perfect for gaming discord etc ,22,3.0

positive,came in timely manner and sound awesome very comfortable,9,1.0
negative,bad quality microphone does not work if you touch the cord at all the headphones don work do not recommend ,20,3.0
positive,the audio quality and fit are pretty nice however key feature needed was mic built into the headset the gain on the mic is maybe making it completely inaudible loud blowing into the mic brings it up to an audible level on playback but far from normal interaction when conversing will continue to use my very old logitech mic which is far superior in audio capture ,66,1.0
positive,love the overall look love how it can light up for when play at night the noise cancellation is awesome really great product invested in,25,2.0

positive,i just purchased this headset because my old one crapped out on me can hear sounds fine but even at max volume it really quiet when tested the mic by doing short recording in audacity it was super quiet and sounded like was inside well covered by blanket when speaking at normal inside volume used different program to rectify this kind of the mic is now better volume but still sounds like crap guess it technically does what it supposed to but even for only thirty ish bucks this headset is not great probably just going to buy different one and keep this one as backup in case need it the only real pro of the headset is that it decently comfortable bottom line don recommend this thing ve spent less on better quality headsets before ,136,1.0

neutral,it didn work for my xbox series put in the adapter and still didn work ,15,5.0
positive,these work great good shutting out noises they sound great you can tell the suround sound good bass only down side to me is they seem to be made for laptop cause the the usb cord for the lights is super short for controller use you could put one of those power bars on it button it just hangs there other then that great buy,65,5.0
neutral,it works really well,4,5.0
positive,love the color and the sound and ability to talk with ease as game ,14,1.0
positive,its great product,3,5.0
neutral,the headphones are made for children heads the earpieces don cover an adult ears the plastic and shape of the headset itself feels cheap and breakable the microphone quality is atrocious and makes anyone speaking through it sound like the stereotypical kid screaming into mic on fortnite ,47,4.0
neutral,does not work with the ps and they are not well made the ear ad came off almost right away and they don even work well with the computer in order to have sound you need mm jack which the ps does not have the usb seems to be power source for the brilliant blue lights don recommend these at all the lights are nice but not worth it since they don do what they should ,76,5.0
negative,i purchased this as an admittedly cheap headset just have something to use until could afford better one and within weeks of owning it the headset stopped working would not be detected at all by any of my pcs had amazon replace it with another one and that nd one failed the exact same way less than hours later unreal would advise anyone looking for headset to look elsewhere terrible cheap awful product ,73,1.0
positive,my son loves these for using with his tablet or plugging into the nintendo switch ,15,5.0
neutral,the cord is very long for use with xbox controller if the usb isn used it just in the way is not plug and play on pc ,27,2.0

neutral,my grandson was so excited to use them with his playstation ,11,1.0
positive,ordered this for my year old son the second he opened it he could tell it was junk but he tried to give it fair shot both my boys are really big into gaming and they said that this is pier crap the microphone doesn work at all he can talk to any of his friends return it but my time is more valuable than this item if your kid is little and he doesn have any friends to talk to this might last week or two but besides that he was pretty upset wouldn buy it if were you had to order him different set so just my opinion if you don know what you re looking for don get this mom doesn know ,125,5.0
positive,these headphones are comfortable and the noise cancelling is great the sound quality is also very good both through the headphones and through the mic the only issue is the wires it impossible to use the lights through the usb and plug in the headphone jack at the same time on my laptop because the usb and headphones inserts are on opposite sides and the wire isn long enough which is really irritating when the actual wire is very long and its just the split wires part that too short the extender they give with the product also seems cheap the sound through the headphones with the extender is completely messed up to the point of it being unusable none of these problems are with the headphones itself so still gave stars but it annoying that can use every feature included honestly the product is solid stars ,147,1.0

neutral,good,1,1.0
positive,i have trouble getting it to keep up good audio sometimes it ok but it been going downhill steadily for year mic has only one axis of rotation so can get it closer to my mouth that part of the issue but only part it also not very comfy as the spring force is too strong and the earmuffs too firm overall they are cheap and they feel like it and sound like it would get something better were you ,80,2.0
neutral,mic cut out periodically and it serves the bare minimum but it stopped working after month of use,18,1.0

neutral,could not get product to work and the cord was too long,12,1.0
neutral,good,1,4.0
negative,this gaming headset does not light up when you play this only lights up when plugged in to the usb for charging only initially bought it because thought the led would show when gaming which is the main purpose but was wrong plus the cables are way to short to have it plugged in and the surround system is bad wouldn recommend buying this cheap mic ,66,5.0
neutral,this is not bluetooth product even though it shows up in results as bluetooth ,14,4.0
negative,the microphone barely detects audio if you re talking at volume any less than screaming painfully uncomfortable to wear with glasses and the sound quality isn much better than my old headset which ve had for years even for only expected something could use for at least minutes before it gave me headache ,53,3.0

positive,the mic is good and the sound quality is also good ,11,4.0
neutral,does work for ps controller just doesn have plug to light up,12,3.0
positive,i ve had these for little over four years now and have had no problems with them at all mic is great sound is great volume control is easy there are blue lights in the headset that light up if you plug the usb portion in for power they are everything need want in headset edit ve used these exclusively with playstation xbox consoles over the past years with no problems but recently ve started using them for pc gaming as well and for some reason the mic does not work with pc sound coming through the headphones is still fine though ,102,5.0

neutral,you can hear the xbox audio in headphones but tv sound still plays ,13,5.0
positive,i got my headset few days after ordered it and it turned out that one side is not working so notified them and right then and there they replaced it with red one as requested because it just goes along with my computer no questions asked the headset looks awesome love the lights anyway besides the awesome lights this has got to be one of the most decent sound wise quality and most awesome looking headsets out there and for very sweet price mean price like that for headset like this is very cheap repeat the price is very cheap for what this headphone worth if you re gamer and do not want to spend crap ton of money for decent headset you might want to try this ,128,3.0
neutral, no stuffing in the box to keep the product for bouncing around in the box which came with dents all in it which can cause the product to become damaged in transit it seems like an issue they could easily address it advertised sound quality that it could not deliver on the sound quality is terribly poor it sounded like was listening to the tv instead of headset even though the sound was coming from the headset this is with the volume on the headset turned all the way up it was advertised as headset that can be used with gaming consoles you need usb for the lights but the chord for that is splits from the aux input and the chord is only inches after the split meaning if you re using controller your not able to enjoy the full experience of the headset because you would need to be have the controller inches from the usb source not to mention the lights aren as bright as advertised in the pictures it advertising noise isolating mic personal testing found this to be false not only could hear the video was listening to on youtube but could hear my air conditioning in the background not what would call noise isolation some people said the headset was too small found it to be too big in my experience either that or they are just too loose because of the padding quality on the ears can shake my head slightly and it ll fall right off when game like to immerse myself in the game which might mean small quick movements and leaning side to side that would cause the headset to fall off your head watch video for demonstration speaking of the padding on the ears that might be what causes this headset to not be noise cancelling my jbl ear buds have more noise cancelling capabilities than this headset does could still hear when someone opened the front door to my building while playing my game will be returning these and requesting refund ,343,1.0
neutral,hubby says these are more comfy to wear than the ones bought him last christmas he plays cod and said that they cancel out the noise of the household going on around him and he able to wear them for several hours without them hurting his ears or head at all ,51,1.0
positive,sounds ok does decent but after month my friends can hear me correctly sound fuzzy and broken to them but the game audio is ok using it on xbox series x,31,5.0

positive,stopped working two days after we received them but the customer service is amazing ,14,1.0
neutral,amazing headset but my only complaint is the people talking to me in discord were hearing themselves talk through the headset and into my mic back to them so had to work on and fix that beside that no complaints,40,4.0
positive,i can attest to how noise canceling they are or the sound quality my kids took them out of the box hated how short the mic was so returned them otherwise think they would ve worked just fine but we had headphones like these at one point in time supposedly bc the mic is too short it doesn come fully at the mouth others you re gaming with have hard time hearing you this is review from kid gamer who shouts at everyone so sure that if they can hear you bc the mic is too far away then that gospel truth in gaming land ,105,5.0

neutral,purchased to of these for myself and wife for the price can complain had them for few months as of now still operating fine,24,5.0
neutral,this is decent headset if you re using it for pc gaming there is no noise cancelation the loudest volume is not that loud to be honest the led lights needs the usb to be plugged in which is on the wire next to the plug you would put into your controller you can use it for playstation or xbox but you can use led unless you have some sort of attachment on your controller with usb port guess should have expected this since it wasn too expensive although for this product think the price is lot this is equivalent to dollar headset based on sound quality no noise cancelation and the led lights not being able to be plugged in especially if you re playing on playstation ,128,3.0
positive,i ve had many headsets over the years and this one sound quality is right up there with the best of the mid priced headsets however the quality of the outgoing sound from the microphone is horrible have played with the same group of friends and they can barely tolerate the sound of my voice when playing ve tried tweaking the voice settings on my computer and have been unable to fix it when using my old headset there aren any issues other than microphone quality the headset it above average ,91,5.0
neutral,i bought this at the end of april and it already acting up have to move it in certain way for me to hear it,25,4.0

neutral,i ve bought this headset multiple times now it is very good for the price but it has few problems the sound quality and microphone are good but the headset it not very comfortable for long gaming sessions and it is prone to breaking after constant use would recommend to anyone looking for cheap headset ,55,4.0

positive,son loves playing with his friends and enjoys the sound quality of the headset he uses it on ps ,19,5.0
positive, bought for gentle pc gamer girl this headset is pretty good one would say the microphone kind of sounds like you re talking on toaster so would recommend getting separate mic setup if you re planning to use these for streaming or making videos the volume control is located on the cord the only complaint have is that it occasionally gets stuck in the arm of my chair and lowers itself the lights are not colored it looks to just be regular led lights in plastic casing so if you re buying these for someone who rages at games they could very easily break them ,105,1.0
positive,better then set highly recommend ,5,1.0

positive,great gaming gear ,3,4.0
negative,ok so am not super tech person and am not sure if this is fixable problem or not but only one side of the headphones work that was the whole reason on buying another pair of headphones because my first pair of different brand started to break and lose hearing in one side just opened mine and yet it has the same problem other than that they seem great just wished mine worked know ,74,5.0

neutral,these are not bad at all for the price whenever playing game online they work and sound great ve only had them about month now but no issues whatsoever ,29,5.0
neutral,good,1,1.0
positive,constant clicking sounds and static over the microphone this product is just terrible and is most likely due to the cheap mm design with no qc over it the sound quality is decent but the cheap plugs they use make it failure since you will end up with the annoying buzzing sound maybe you can get lucky and get headphone with the plugs properly fitted but chances are even little bump here or there will easily knock it off place good luck taking your chances with this product ,88,5.0
neutral,no sound and hard to talk,6,1.0

positive,love the over all sixe and make of the unit the mic has no problem and one you set the volume to hear others on the phone or computer you are good to go th long chord is bit much for close phone use so the velcro tab was hepful till set tie rap as workout or in my wheel chair dose not need trip hazards ,66,1.0
positive,the microphone is too short so if you have big head the people ur talking to won be able to hear you ,22,1.0
neutral,poor sound quality like if someone stuffed papper towel or cotton ball in it ,14,3.0
neutral,they were decently sounding with good amount of noise cancellation however these were more intended for pc because there is two cords one for sound and one for the lights the cord is too short to connect it to the ps also the cord is big and gets in the way too much while gaming ,55,5.0
positive,solid gaming headset for very good price over the ear provides good noise cancellation the plastic materials used in the headset feel little cheap but ve had my headset for the last few years and it still works well,39,4.0

negative,horbile never worked be careful they fool u,8,5.0
neutral,this headset is so big and bulky especially for kid the audio is fine and is better than most budget headsets the mic started having static issues after months every time you slightly move the cable the static is incredibly loud through the mic to the people you re playing with that tells me the internal components are poor quality or poorly put together ,64,5.0
positive,when got this immediately ran into problems with the mic my friends couldn hear me and could barely hear them it never picked up my voice no matter how loudly spoke they would hear every other word but never the complete sentence tried to work with it for weeks but ended up using my webcam mic for while because it sounded better and could be heard ,66,5.0

neutral,noise cancelation is what my grandson liked,7,5.0
neutral,gift,1,2.0
positive,really nice headset the only note ve got is if you are using this for ps the usb placement to power up the lights on the headset is right next to the audio jack like connected away not very practical and you have to put usb extension on it if you want to power up the lights could care less about the lights so ve got high marks for this great noise cancellation sound is crisp and headset is very comfortable ,81,4.0
neutral,worked well at first few months later all incoming sounds came in sounding like the speakers were blown they just keep getting worse it so difficult understanding people ,28,5.0

positive,amazing product ,2,3.0
positive,grandson was happy,3,5.0
neutral,the noise canceling is false at first when used them they were good owned pairs of these and the same problem happened with both after while the sound only goes to one side you have to mess with the volume adjustment to get both sides to work if you move it even little it only works on one side again will not be buying again,65,1.0

positive,this is great headset for the price it does what need it to do,14,1.0
neutral,volume level needs to be high for microphone to work normally but the high volume has way too much base and hurts your ears plus the ear muffs are too small need to spend about or more on quality headsets like astro turtle beach or other brands ,47,5.0
positive,these headphones so far are great no complaints purchased for year old gamer in may so still fairly new,19,5.0

positive,i like the head phones the sound is good ,9,3.0
neutral,the good decent sound quality and relatively comfortable the bad uses an analogue jack for the speakers making plugging it into certain devices difficult or impossible without an add on like splitter the microphone is an inflexible piece of plastic and people talk to online complain about my voice being muffled and distorted overall overpriced for what amounts to an okay pair of headphones ,64,4.0
negative,at the start noticed that they weren that loud even with the volume on ignored it though because it wasn that bad regret doing that because now they got even lower with the sound on this product isn worth buying ,40,3.0

positive,great for people who game alot,6,5.0
positive,i like stuff loud bit of an audiophile but don like spending lot unless it worth it prefer cheap and effective and that is this used to use the official playstation wireless headphones that cost over and those were great but then they stopped charging and got these freed up the usb port that was being used by the wireless headphones because these headphones plug into the wireless controller so for lot less money it still wireless and they sound great ,81,5.0

positive,i had been looking for gaming headset for my ps casual gamer and was looking for something that could use when play late at night read the reviews for this product and convinced me to buy when received it was surprised how big the headphones are but it wasn big deal when tried them on they felt comfortable and have been using them for long period of time and my ears have not gotten tired the sound quality is surprisingly good with good bass and can hear the surround sound effects of my games the voice chat quality is very good with clear quality in terms of noise cancellation it not true noise cancellation can still hear sounds form outside when playing but it minimal overall pleased with these headphones as they do their job just fine ,137,1.0

neutral,very nice and sturdy just heavy on head ,8,5.0
negative,the headset is nice but the cord on the actual product is different from the instructions there are two jacks one for the game controller and usb connection to power the lights if you look at the pictures the split is further down closer to the jacks than what is explained in the instructions doubt anyone would be able to use the lights unless they re sitting next to an outlet also there isn much room to use the controller if the usb is connected to power source poor design of the cord ,93,4.0

positive,this product was little disappointing to be honest for one wish had paid attention to the fact that this is not wireless second the lights don come on with mic jack which sure it wouldn make sense to but it really should have just been usb with an adaptor otherwise if you don care about lights it works fine say it better suited for pc gaming since usually there mic jack next to usb port but not for consoles its not the worst just the sound quality is kind of minimal it doesn play music too well it can get loud but then the sound gets shrill amd will induce headach truthfully wouldn buy this again ,116,1.0

neutral,i recently ordered these headphones after having logitech headset go out on me after few weeks of owning them for the price they are really good ,26,1.0
positive,keep in mind this is my first bengoo headset so assume it rare case however this was not great first impression was using it on my pc but it probably works best as console headset the headset itself looks great the speaker sounds nice and love the design for not only the aesthetic but the mic buttons on the cable as well unfortunately that all positive comments can give the setup app did not connect to the headset no matter if enabled it on windows defender or restarted the computer for it to reset not only that it takes attempts to open the app needed to end the background task of the first attempt to open it then it didn even recognize the headset at all no options to configure or anything trying to use another app for the setup was annoying and had me constantly checking the ports when finally got connected to the mic was greeted with the sound of rain like static that was louder than my own voice volume the volume of the mic itself was so low needed to increase it to the maximum value it also has default super bass feel to it that makes your voice more muffled than recognizable was hoping to replace my pc gaming headset but can say feel confident buying this one ,223,4.0
neutral,it works good for year but after the mic went out had to order new adapter and month later the mic stoped working agan the adapter was ,27,5.0
neutral,this is by far the wosrt head set ve yet to get only two weeks in and absolutely despised it the mic is way to far away from your mouth even with sensitivity all the way up my friends could barely hear me it fixed mic all it can do is go up and down far to stiff feels like vice around my head mic quality is garbage sounds canny and fuzzy honestly you can buy better headsets for the same price not as good but better than this dumpster fire of headset at least it ll make decent target practice,101,5.0

positive,my boys love to game on their computer xbox and nintendo switch this headset is great for all gaming experience great sound and microphone the only reason did not give it stars is the cord can get tangled easily and when that happens it doesn give the star experience have bought several of these though and will continue to get the same as they get worn out the price for the quality of the product is worth it ,78,4.0
neutral,i have year and month with mine and havent run in any issues so far ,15,4.0
positive,my husband enjoys movies however his taste and my taste aren the same since getting these headphones we can be in the same room with him enjoying movie on his laptop while watching movie on tv my husband says the sound quality of these headphones is good as far as noise cancelling he says that some background noise does creep in but not enough to interfere with whatever movie he watching pleased with these headphones and will probably buy another pair for my grandson ,84,5.0

neutral,i bought this because it is gaming headphone and the reviews looked to be good quality however plugged it into my pc and at first only the audio output was working and recognized on my computer when unplugged it to see if that would fix the microphone not being recognized the sound stopped working ran troubleshoot program and the pc doesn even acknowledge the headphones being plugged in with the jack looked online its very common problem ,77,1.0
neutral,i seen in the description that it said it would work for xbox one went no further after receiving the head phones we noticed it did not work for xbox one so opened the instructions and there we seen that an adapter is needed for xbox one and it is dont buy these for xbox as between this and the adapter you will spend almost ,65,1.0

negative,its really bad,3,5.0
negative,the good the price and they work the bad very short coord more suited for laptop user than desktop requires both usb and mm ports to be used for either to work disconnect one and headset stops very poor sound its too quiet forget noise cancellation you can hear your phone ring on medium with these on full sound on youtube for some reason the left ear is hotter than the right side assuming because mic is on the left side have bought headphones half this price from sades that had much better sound and coord length but sadly they didnt have red and black anymore should of went with blue and black this headset was twice as expensive and nothing to be happy about will not buy another from this company,132,1.0

positive,bought these after my kids broke my sony gold headset while these do not have as great features at the gold headsets as don offer as well sound quality and noise cancellation while also being wireless expected step down in quality as was purchasing something to bare the damage they might face until my kids and cats could learn to mind others things while they are step down surprised at how much like them like the volume control on the cord rather than the headset so can see if it if need to and while not as great they do have some noise cancellation there isn much base nor any surround sound features but for this price point think that would be asking for too much overall happy with them and until feel the need to get more expensive pair these will be what use will definitely hold onto them as backup pair if ever do upgrade as well ,159,1.0

positive,this is specifically for the green and black bengoo professional gaming headset the quality of this headset for the price is near unbeatable headset feels very durable kid proof it made of abs plastic with metal inserts on the adjustable band the ear cushions on these are pleather pillow cushions and they are extremely comfortable have an absolutely huge head and these fit just right the ear cups fit over my ears entirely and they do decent job of blocking out ambient sound the headset is very light weight making it very comfortable to use for long play sessions had no ear or head pain from wearing these for extended periods of time the integrated volume control and mute switch work very well the cord is extra long ft and it braided the entire way this cord feels pretty premium and even has velcro cord wrap on it it comes with pc splitter just in case you have setup like that the usb only powers the led lights and they are very green therefore the usb does not have to be plugged in but is nice touch if you re into that sort of thing personally really like the lights and think they are nice but don use them every time either microphone quality is very good and the noise canceling system seems to work extremely well on it only time echo was noticed was when volume was at and even then it was not bad at all went through numerous headsets in the last three weeks trying to find microphone that didn echo all my friends voices back at the slightest sound of speech seriously it was pathetic how garbage the microphones are on the expensive hyper and nacon rig headsets sound quality is superb for the price point these are pretty bass heavy if you like that sort of thing very reminiscent of skullcandy sound quality like this type of sound myself because in shooter you literally feel the bass with this headset highs are also good if not little less pronounced and had no problem hearing footsteps in shooters in games like fortnite that exactly what you want these also sound very well with directional audio like dolby atmos so definitely recommend these for surround sound gaming as well my one minor complaint is that the cord for the usb is not long enough and it did not come with an extender that small price to pay though considering everything else is so good about these headphones now own multiple bengoo products this is brand trust in not only are they quality brand but their customer service is absolutely excellent wouldn hesitate to buy this brand for any of your audio needs ,455,4.0

negative,the sound is crystal clear and the wire prevents easy entanglement but ve noticed something after couple of weeks of use the ear pieces aren comfortable for adults due to them being too small and what even worse is that wear glasses and it makes it even more uncomfortable for me and even making it difficult to focus during gaming have to constantly try to move them around just for it to be bearable in comfort so warning not recommended with glasses and or adults ,85,1.0

neutral,day used it on my gaming pc huge issues this headset by default will default itself to the speakers microphone on your pc laptop under the default settings making it very hard to make games and discord to detect the headset and ultimately cuck you re stream setting abilities after hours of fiddling with settings finally was able to make it work correctly day doesn work at all now microphone works but the headset now doesn produce any sound and yes did make sure my volume was turned all the way up through the hardware and software sides understand that chose cheap product to fulfill my needs of headset but don out right sell faulty and useless product waste of time and money ,123,5.0
neutral,just arrived and my son was so excited we plug it into the sony ps controller not off brand and nobody can hear him chat in fortnight my husband plugged it into his phone and the microphone worked why not the ps that what we bought it for so it basically useless for our needs ,55,4.0

neutral,for the price it good to use for gaming with other players over the ps system,16,3.0
negative,i just got these mins ago and tried them first off it doesn light up unless you plug both ends into port which means console players won get the light up second it just all around horrible with its sound thee most quiet whisper like sound bought it on the grounds of the high rating and good reviews but it didn come close to standards don know if this is just defective or what but this ain it and am quite disappointed in the money just gave to company that couldn even hold standard for gaming ,96,5.0
positive,is came with one side of the headset not working then when speaking into the mic the other party couldn hear what was being said recommend maybe different one if this worked for you great but on my end it didn the box came little beat up looking too also very light weight feel like they would have broke easily sent it back for refund ,65,5.0

neutral,the sounds is good on them,6,5.0
neutral,mute button does not work,5,1.0
neutral,product doesn work,3,3.0
positive,st off this product advertises as if there are lights on it there aren its just sticker that doesn have any led function very misleading nd the headset is very poorly made the earpieces barely fit my year old they are far too small to fit an adults ears rd the sound quality is subpar takes lot of adjustment and you get better quality from an xbox default headset do not buy this ,73,2.0
positive,got these today and not sure if should even use them specially after learning most it reviews are fake bought new console along side these and not going to risk losing new controller if the adapter decides to break off inside it like some reviewers say the first red flag for me was definitely the packaging it was packed in large box with bubble wrap and just felt unofficial there was also wear on the ear pieces indicating prior use and the worst part is you don even have to use them in game to tell the mic is defective as it won even reach the front of you re face the cord as well as volume slider are bit obnoxious in size and the product overall feels like fragile plastic off brand did test them on my switch and the sound was surprisingly good noticed background static at first which lot of people mentioned but it wasn terrible or even noticeable at times ll probably stash these away for backup pair and just buy name brand pair for the same or even better price and if you are also looking for solid gaming headset then please help yourself and look away from these ,204,5.0
positive,loved the headset incredible sound,5,5.0
positive,great headphones,2,4.0
neutral,so just got these today and was excited however upon setting them up noticed that the light up function is only usable when hooking up the attached usb to the port on my ps stupidly enough there isn enough cable split to also connect the headphones to your controller in order to use the headphones for its sole purpose it either they light up on the damn counter and look cute or you talk to friends while playing online but there is no both so can you say complete design flaw false advertisement and bottom line this company needs to close shop and go flip burgers ,106,3.0
positive,this works well for my son xbox series he likes it would have given stars if the usb cord that is to inserted into the port on the xbox was longer because that cord is so short he not able to experience the blue led while playing ,47,5.0

positive,i recently tried to go back to an old pair of headphones and found them to be lacking so opted to buy second pair of these since had used them before and enjoyed them after side by side comparison these headphones are more comfortable have much higher audio quality and overall feel like they have better build quality than other headphones ve used if you re looking for great product that looks good and for lower price than high end ones buy these you certainly won regret it ,88,5.0
positive,i love this and it works great you can adjust the sound and mute your mic very easily the only down side is that you need usb port to make it light up it really does not matter if it lighted up or not but play on ps and only have remote don have pc to plug the usb into to make it light up but overall love it ,69,3.0
positive,had few issues but customer service was awesome problem was resolved immediately overall would buy headset again ,17,1.0
neutral,the cord is stupid it like its backwards only way to use the lights is plug the cord in and the cord for the lighst is literally foot long that means you are foot in front of the tv when you play game ridiculous,44,5.0

neutral,spend little more get real pair,6,5.0
neutral,my son like this for playing online games on his xbox had previous turtle headset that he loved but that had gotten damage after long use this item was confusing to use there separate usb cord plug adapter that can be plugged in if you re using it on laptop or computer that will also make the unit light up but the lights only work if the usb cord is plugged in during play sound often times would not work and microphone would intermittently cut in and out update now works better after resetting and updating controller for xbox volume and on off switchis bulky and uncomfortable returning product going to buy another turtle,114,5.0
positive,friend who this was bought for said the headphones had good sound quality from his games he was playing but the microphone is muffled and you can barely make out what he saying through voice chat probably ok if you don care about being heard the design looks nice enough ,50,5.0

positive,i bought it for my boyfriend and his exact words where the quality is juicy meaning it was the best choice for him to do his gaming,27,1.0
positive,my son is happy with this headset setup easily and sound great ,12,1.0
neutral,the sound quality on these is absolutely terrible for gaming tried them with music as well also terrible the volume wheel is upside down backwards the mic is worthless and not working properly the led lights are worthless for gaming on anything other than pc it is one cord with very small split at the end one to go into the controller and the other is usb for the lights to work but you can use the lights and play on the ps or xbox at the same time which makes these pretty pointless in that aspect there is no noise cancelation whatsoever out of would not recommend these look and sound nice when you read the description and reviews but they are absolute trash wouldn even buy them for my kids ,132,1.0
positive,for the price it works fine and is comfortable can wear it for hours and it doesn hurt have no idea about noise cancelling not an audiophile or anything but it sounds fine to me for my needs have asked people on the other end if the mic sounds good and they say they can hear me fine it is loud enough but do wish it was able to get even louder for some uses rating it stars for filling my needs but stars on the gaming scale because while can hear footsteps and surround sound sure it must not be as good as turtle beach or something ve also had it for years and no issues no idea about the lights because ve never plugged that in ,128,5.0
positive,the headset barely fit on my head after constant adjustment and tweaking would have to put pair of socks on top of my head in order for it to be comfortable and fit ,33,3.0
positive,cool looking comfortable light weight ,5,5.0
positive,i wrote negative review for this purchase company reached out to me and offered replacement free of charge while really appreciate the replacement found the new set of headphones had the same issue as the original choppy sound is not an ideal way to immerse yourself into game truly appreciate the company effort but can recommend this product ,58,5.0
neutral,this thing sucks you have to be to close to the system for comfort tried it on my ps and it doesn work at all for ps not satisfied especially with how close to have to be to use the head set in the ps because in order to turn it on it has to be plugged into the back and the cord to plug into the controller isn very long at all so my hands had to be right up in the ps and it wasn comfortable at all,90,5.0
positive,grandkids are enjoying this ,4,5.0
neutral,do not buy,3,5.0
positive,perfect sound and quality perfect for those who are looking good headset ,12,1.0
positive,for gaming and even for non gaming gripe have about this headset is the volume and mic controller it like you have remote control super glued on the cord and it swings around and knocks up against your arm or chair the usb cable is also an annoying addition it cool for people who want glowing headsets but for people who don need to waste the energy for the lights it an additional cord just hanging off of your laptop or desktop so the design could definitely be better as for the noise cancellation not completely sure what noise cancelling these headsets actually have tested the mic and even with the mic all the way up you have to manually mute yourself using the volume controller otherwise people can still hear you but you will seem like you re far away from the computer the sound quality is okay played games and watched movies with these while watching shows movies with just the aux mm jack did notice some voice echoing this isn super ideal depending on what you are trying to watch or listen to but some people may enjoy this the headset does have cushy padding on the ears but it seems pretty small so for those with larger ears these might be more of on ear headphones rather than over ear ones the cushion does eventually hurt to keep the headset on for an extended period of time but hoping after wearing the cushion down bit the comfortability will increase overall the headset is okay since got it on sale it decent set of headphones ,268,5.0
positive,i love it soon as got it got on the game and got my first win in free for all oh the led lights only come on when plug em in ur game so,34,5.0

negative,the sound is going in and out shake the headset and the sound reconnects then it gone for the majority of the time terrible quality doesn last long at all ,30,5.0
positive, update have finally tried with my pc and tried on both mine and my husbands and the sound works fine it not very noise canceling but it is nice to hear the base and actually pick up on detail otherwise wouldn have heard without it the downfall is that the mic won work at all of course played with the toggle and made sure it wasn my computer settings and it still isn working put in for return so hopefully this one is defective and the new headset will be better super bummed because really wanted to like this headset bought this gaming headset specifically for my ps and as advertised it states that it is compatible and it is not have the original sony ps controllers so it not even like using off brand ve tried with both of my controllers and nothing have not tried with my pc yet will update my review once try it with the pc,161,5.0
positive,i bought these for work they allow me to blockout most of the conversations in the room and allow me to focus on my own thoughts sound quality is good listen to music audiobooks and participate in video conferences they are not too heavy am able to wear them all day with my mask and eyeglasses they do not apply extra pressure to me ears ,65,3.0

neutral,upon receiving these was so excited to see these lit up while use them to game on my xbox the design of them is bisually appealing upon unboxing the pink looked little cheap but sure the other colors with black would have been better was saddened to discover that in order for them to light up you have to plug them into usb which the splitter for this is very inconveniently placed close to the controller and the cord is extremely short so that was big after being bummed about that shrugged it off and started gaming with them anyway got minutes into my game when sound started breaking up another minutes later and they completely stopped working tested my old headset just to be sure and the old worked verifying the headset was junk sending back and paying the extra for turtle beach ,144,5.0
positive,i use these for gaming music videos schoolwork pretty much everything spanning both pc and console experiences they work great and still work great after almost year of ownership the chord is tad unwieldy with its length and the headphones aren ideal for noise canceling other than that can find any issues ,52,1.0

positive,great customer service and decent headset for the price ,9,5.0
neutral,not worth it if you re looking for something to work longer than couple of months my son was able to get couple of months use out of it before the mic stopped working then he would have to hold the cord certain way for him to hear out of one side it wasn worth doing all that so we tossed it since was passed the return deadline would be very weary of those so called stars reviews ,78,5.0

neutral,sound is muffled lights vibrant but useless unless you re connecting to laptop for gaming the split is too short to connect it to the console what makes it light up and simultaneously to the gaming controller what makes it useful so for gaming the lights will not be on while wearing the headset mic like so many other complaints doesn work returning this item ,65,5.0

positive,i used these headphones mainly for gaming on my playstation but they worked just as good on my pc ve bought more expensive gaming headphones and these can compete with those except for the noise canceling but it not bad the long chord gives you room for gaming from distance and the volume control on the chord is nicely placed the led lights looks pretty nice and the fact you have an option to use them or not but still use the headphones is nice addition ,86,1.0

negative,i didn expect too much but the headset broke within week ,11,5.0
positive,i am by no means headset snob have some specifications that want met for gaming headset these headphones check lot of boxes but not all of them unfortunately will be looking for new headset because the microphone is pretty muffled am in party chat days week my friends have stated that the mic is muffled and kind of muddy louder sounds make their way through the mic for example gunshots loud animal calls in hunting game loud screams effects from scary game etc the mic is fixed this is obvious with the photos but didn realize how much it would effect me can adjust how close or far the mic is from my mouth and therefore can really try to fix mic quality the plastic quality is ehh it feels little cheaper but you get what you re paying for with budget headset the bass was not all that impressive have had lot worse but also much better as well say it bass rating and this is one of the most important features for me everything else about the headset is great but don recommend it for gaming with friends their best features include long braided cord crisp loud and powerful sound comfortable and light with great quality earmuffs great designcons fixed mic bad mic quality not best for really small losing sound quality or really large losing comfort head lacking amazing bass,233,1.0
positive,lasted about months we bought cheap headset knowing they wouldn last long my son is hard in headsets so at this point it better to order cheap and replace often instead of really expensive ones that still don last good quality for the value,44,2.0

negative,couldn beat the price on this headset just wanted something cheap that would work decent of course it seems like pretty cheap plastic but it doesn really bother me they don hurt my head ears or anything like that when wear them for long periods of time unlike other headphones headsets they light up which is cool but you can plug that part into controller because it usb for the lighting overall haven had any complaints from the people play with online no comments about how bad it sounds or anything so assuming the mic works just fine and so does the sound that comes through the headset ,108,1.0
positive,i received the kotion each by bengoo headphones last christmas as gift thought for sure these were headphones when tried them on my ps they sounded great and gave my girlfriend peace because she now did not have to hear rdr constantly could fish ride horses hunt and have shootouts with outlaws all day long do not play online so cannot say to the microphone quality but have used it few times on zoom calls and no one had issues hearing me am also musician and filmmaker and am very picky about sound quality let be clear crystal clear get it these are not sennheiser headphones but they are very good quality for the price for casual use could not believe the price when looked them up would edit an album or film with these yes for rough cutting but would grab something more reputable for sound final mixing for video and definitely not use these for sound mixing music the mix coming out of these is little on the bass side for me but not enough one couldn get used to in few minutes and only know they are slightly bass because my ear is trained to hear that stuff most people will not notice this at all they have lasted just fine for year and are still going light plastic body but nothing has fallen off it yet also take very good care of my things and do not toss them on tables couches etc so cannot speak to how robust they are for people who like to throw things across rooms do not ever pull on the cord etc mine came with split connector mm usb which does come in handy sometimes but the extra dangly cord not being used can be annoying also the cord is waaaaay long feet ish which is great and also annoying depending on your usage but would take more cord than not enough any day the in line volume knob is great for when different streaming services like to pump out different volumes and your ears get blasted when your show starts no need to get up and change the computer volume just lay on the couch and adjust the dial on the cord reversely the dial is great to pump up the volume bit for those highly compressed videos on the web that are too low to hear overall it gets stars if it had treble bass adjustment knob it would get cheers to your ears ,416,5.0
neutral,i like everything about them,5,3.0

neutral,first you can either have the headset glowing or you can actually use the mic pick one you cant have both secondly maybe its just mine but my headset is completly lopsoded crocked however you want me to say it third due to it being uneven sound quality isnt great no noise cancelation and its not as loud as would like it last its uncomfortable period,66,5.0

positive,the headphones are amazing bass boosting is insanely good however the microphone in little over week of having this headset began to crackle and cut out my friends kept telling me they couldn hear me or outright telling me that all they got was static and crackling tried everything from updating my drivers to tampering with sound settings to reseating the audio cables into different ports the only conclusion was left with was the cable was somehow so poorly made that it failed in just over week am extremely disappointed could ve spent somewhere else four and half stars how ,100,5.0

neutral,would not recommend these to anyone they are too small and put way to much pressure on your ears lights are just gimmick she your money and search around for something better ,32,4.0
negative,i bought these about year ago and when received them they appeared to be fine but when used them the cord is heavy thick and tugging the worst part is that if you ever take off the black wrap around the cord the cord will dwindle and tangle until it decides to do it until it permanently damages itself used them for about hours one day and never touched them even though they were annoying and noticed in video clip saved the microphone cut out randomly but audio still coming through the headset and was confused because never did anything to damage them so they eventually damage themselves by tangling asked my dad to get me another pair of headphones and told him not the same ones but by the time they had already arrived it had been the same and he didn realized that he bought the same pair but figured give them another shot once again they tangled themselves to death one day and realized how cheap this company was and how terrible their products are and how cheaply made they are if there is anything in this review you note down do not but these headphones the worst part is them tangling beyond repair and the annoyance of the excess weight to the cord quite embarrassing for the company to own such terrible product ,227,4.0

positive,on the outside this headset looks great and fits comfortably not sure if mine is defective or just had something come loose in shipping but it doesn quite work right the microphone works fine and the left earpiece works fine the rights side is where the problem is have to move the cord just right to hear out of it if this was headset say it fine but for feel like should at least be able to hear out of both sides without having to do yoga position to get it to work properly overall say it not bad but also not great do with that what you will ,109,3.0

positive,ok so just going to avoid beating around the bush and get right to it the headset is acceptable especially given the current pricetag but it not great it really not have sensitive ears had problems with them relating to heat and pressure so avoided headphones sets for while but eventually saw how for the world of gaming headsets dominate over earbuds so have been on the lookout for comfortable one ever since lil beating around the bush there know no more swear good the top headrest part is very soft and squishy we like this it blue love blue the cord is well made doesn look like it tearing anytime soon bad they re not that comfortable they re not torturous but have skullcandy headphones that are way easier to wear game sound is very average can hear decently but for games like fortnite that have bad audio to begin with this isn going to change anything ugly don know if this is defect but if you plug this into your phone or tablet and bend the cord lil while on call it ll hang up you watching youtube video cord moves slightly and it skips to the next video you see how infuriating this can be it pronged connection they have added usb connection only for the lights get it but at the same time just remove the lighting no one wants to have usb cord swinging everywhere when not using it on pc the mic doesn mute when you flip it up thought this was an industry standard but apparently not you have to manually mute your mic with the switch on the panel that dangles on your cord so that pretty much it honestly you be getting around the same quality with clearance pair at your local electronics store and without the very annoying end call bug would have returned but was too lazy eh it ll work as backup suppose edit bengoo customer service took the initiative and contacted me giving out refund to my amazement was concerned it was possibly scam but they worked with me to refund me without compromising any personal information whatsoever huge thanks to bengoo for having the service more popular companies should have ,374,1.0

positive,i think they are good especially for the price but wish that they were more adjustable they are great for sitting up and listening to tv or gaming but if you want to lay down or have them adjusted to your head they are not good they feel bulky and don quite fit to my head for someone with slightly larger head they may fit however with them not being adjustable think my problem would be flipped if someone with really large head put them on as they are not adjustable also the two connection types with one cord hanging all the time is just huge bother and it is definitely design flaw there should be some way to tuck the unused connector up so it doesn dangle and become nuisance sound noise cancelling and upright use is all good though gave it because of these factors ,147,4.0
neutral,in order for your lights to work you would need hdmi extender to connect to your controller and or outlet,20,1.0
neutral,so bought it because it was on sale for dollars that should have been my first hint the sound quality was terrible ve had better call quality on ham radio from the freinds said it echoed and had static sound and there is about football feild length of wire hanging on it that just irritating ,55,1.0

neutral,works as advertised and looks great little bulky for my tastes but it does its job note as others mentioned the wording on the headset itself is different than in the picture displayed but it is the same model would star it if it was little more comfy for long hours of use but after an hour or two because of its weight and bulk it really starts to become uncomfortable for me ,73,1.0
neutral,took days to ship so much for prime next day shipping and won light up without being plugged into usb waste of time and money ,25,2.0
positive,i don like the fact that the mike doesn pick up voice very well its about half the reason why bought it the overall construction is not very sturdy the plastic is brittle the leds work as advertised but it takes an entire usb port so you need three open ports on the front of the pc just to have the headphones work with features the headphones themselves are uncomfortable and not better than the cheap headset was using before the audio quality isn great pros they look cool but that about it don pay full price for these glad didn ,101,5.0

neutral,it not damaged the cord isn messed up but bought it and today it already done lol if connect it the sound doesn fully come through like as if you have to keep adjusting the cable like an old school broken ipod the mic isn working bc of this terrible would have rather bought another brand same price don buy ,60,5.0

neutral,i am told people can barely hear me when im not talking loud its probably the distance the mic is from my face bc its worse when the mic isn all the way down also dont use the lights on this hook it into my game controller which is way too far from any computers to be able to plug the usb in at the same time which powers the lights if ur audio plug is right next to usb plug there shouldn be much issue this does not have the feature that turns the mic off when the bar containing the mic is up over all got this on primeday and its my st headset ive used for gaming its functional,122,5.0

neutral,i ve had this headset for less than months and the mic has already started to go out have to have the cord certain way for it to work if the mic is working and move the cord whoever is on the other end can hear ridiculous amount of feedback play on twitch streams so it great to go back to watch and all you can focus on is the feedback from this headset not worth the spent rather buy razer headset that ll cost me more in the beginning but don have to worry about it braleaking months in ,100,3.0

positive,my kid liked these headphones for his gaming system but really like them for doing my telehealth video sessions for work ,21,1.0
positive,for the price it not bad headset sound quality is good could use sound booster like button to increase the bass or treble that just my opinion after using multiple headsets that comes with those features overall they are right in the middle as far as sound and price is concerned also the cord is alil long like foot long wish it was shorter there is also two connects at the end it split with the headphone jack and usb at the end of the cord not really big thing but it does get in the way sometimes ,98,3.0

neutral,i ordered these for myself my current headset just reached the end of it life and needs replaced these appeared similar and were near the same in price but oh boy the quality first off unless you have an extremely tiny head or are child these are not for you the ear cuffs are absurdly small had my japanese roommate try them on and even he laughed at how ridiculously tiny they were there no way you could wear these for any length of time without getting headache from the pressure to your ears but hey maybe they ll sound great and can get past that nope the audio was muffled and quiet had to turn my volume up five fold to hear anything compared to my worn out set the set that literally falling part sound better come on all of this comes after waiting much longer delivery time than quoted by almost week and when the package did arrive it was crushed headset seemed unharmed but with the sound quality who knows maybe that factor can say all can say is that these are absolute junk ,188,1.0

neutral,people could barely hear me no matter how close the mic was to my face,15,5.0
positive,they do feel cheap and that ok for the price but the mic and sound are better than expected so you won be disappointed of you consider the price the mic is loud and clear and it does an amazing job at filtering my music playing on the background so it just picks up my voice and does not disturb other players ,62,4.0

positive,had some issues with my first headphones purchased and customer service reached out to me to rectify the situation and the new pair they sent is amazing pleasantly surprised with the quality thank you guys again for going above and beyond for your customers ,44,5.0
neutral,use for gaming noise cancellation could be better ,8,2.0
positive,this is great for beginner gamers the headset is comfy which is important because we use it for hours and hate when headsets gives headaches from the pressure it does cancel outside noise pretty well but you can still hear bit which prefer since would like to know if being spoken to when playing but you have to take headsets off to actually hear other people in the room like that you can use in the pc and ps because the headset jack works with the ps remotes like others mentioned the usb has to be connected to light up for us we don mind the light not being lit up so it not big issue after all when you are the user you really don look at yourself unless you are streaming live with face view and you want that extra flare only issue had which isn big issue is the mute for the mic isn easily accessible and the switch is sometimes hard to quickly use when gaming for those times when you want to be muted so others don hear every background noise or family talking so find myself trying to switch between mute while playing which is hard when you are playing fps games and in an intense section but that might be me not able to multitask that quickly lol just wished the mute button was button possibly or the slide switch it does has was higher up the flush so you aren stumbling trying to slide plus it doesn really feel like it slides all the way so you are double checking know went into depth of the issue but it isn huge issue just my input maybe when they decide to make another model they can put that into consideration overall love it going to buy couple more for our gaming family ,309,2.0

positive,overall the set is fine nothing ridiculous you get what you pay for pretty much just needed fair priced pair to replace my blown out ones perhaps my biggest gripe about this product is that the volume knob is total joke there is very little range on the adjustment to the volume compared to how much the knob is able to turn on the way to turning it up the majority of the time you re turning the knob your volume is not adjusting the range feels like it begins and ends within less than third of the knob ability to turn in the volume increase direction ,107,2.0
neutral,i wouldn buy this headset simply because the mic on it picks up little sound and you have to be very loud to get good quality,26,5.0

neutral,i was trying to play the ps with my friend but couldn here him and he couldn here me ,19,1.0
positive,i did lot of research on amazon looking for new cheaper gaming headset for my son he seems to have the worst luck when it comes to cheaper gaming headsets but guess you get what you pay for however with these they work great sound quality is good voice and mute work good the lights do not light up unless you have the usb cord connected to another source my son uses his for the ps so no lights for us doesn really matter though since he cannot see the lights anyway they work and that what matters most the extra connector does come in the box ,107,5.0

positive,these do not fit on the head well my head falls under the size fits most category in terms of hats glasses and headsets this does not additionally they do not cancel any noise at all finally the one received had to have the mic put right to my mouth to pick up any sounds no matter how much played around with the settings understand that this is cheap pair but that doesnt mean that the product shouldnt work sound quality is alright ,83,3.0

positive,got these as an intended upgrade for previous headset got from walmart wasn expecting much but wish had kept the walmart headset now that ve tested these they work just fine for video playback no real complaints there my main issues are how incredibly cheap they feel and how crummy the microphone is the store page claims it has noise isolation to better pick up your voice but from my basic voice recording tests comparing my laptop and this microphone my laptop consistently provides louder clearer results compared to this headset there was still quite noticeable background noise in the headset recording as well there also some design flaws with how the microphone is implemented it is completely rigid peice of plastic that only rotates vertically so it just ends up hanging good to inches from your mouth when deployed yes got out ruler and measured it that off this is compared to other headset mics which can be adjusted as needed to sit much closer and in front of your mouth instead of beside it the cheap feeling is the next biggest flaw simply put the glossy plastic used on the exterior of the muff housing reminds me of cheap toy the case on the connecting band is bit better being made from matte plastic but not by much the only things on this device that don feel like they were slapped together for as low material cost as possible are the ear mouths and the braided cord which comes with nice plastic protectors for both the mm audio jack and the usb that powers the contractually obligated gamer lights have honestly forgone the lights for better build quality on the muff housing and microphone that actually somewhat flexible so can actually hear myself speak overall average playback quality nothing that would impress an audiophile but nowhere near terrible it painfully average and unfortunately that more than can be said for the rest of the device bad microphone design and quality just don bother got better results from the built in microphone array in my thinkpad from than did with this thing el cheapo feel like toy from dollar store verdict if you care about quality in your headset don buy this they sell this thing for at regular price got it for about half off with the amazon prime discount even still somewhat regret spending money on this thing and be leagues more disappointed had paid the full asking price for it it barely worth it weight at ish dollars and there no way it worth the normal if you just want something for discreet audio playback go find better headset or just settle for some earbuds there plenty of decent options for the latter under both in retail stores and online this one isn worth your time or your money the only reason even keeping this is because returning products has always been pain in my experience and because the headset itself technically works but that it it not even worth the hassle of chasing down refund ,510,4.0

positive,great headset for the money,5,1.0
positive,i ordered two pairs of these headphones one for me and another for my brother not even two weeks and they ve already ran their course at first they were bit tight on the head enough to give headaches if not removed after few hours this eventually eased up as the first week went on the real issue came in for us days after first using them like many others have been saying here one day the mic was fine and the next day all of sudden its quality was way lower than what it was prior audio then coming through lot more stuffy and the mic having hard time picking up any sounds at all only when cranked up the decibel settings to max it was able to pick up feint sounds one of them still works fine on our xbox but when it comes to pc they re both on the way out already will most definitely be looking elsewhere for our tech needs in the future ,169,5.0
neutral,this headset is the worst for gaming no stereo so there is no difference if the enemy is on the right or left you can hear it as one sound the noise cancellation is amazing to the point you are screaming just so people can hear you talking normal sound quality is ok besides that useless hanging usb plug for lights don have small head and don have huge head and it slides down off my ears after some time it snug for about an hour super light weight plastic junk when received them thought what was in the box was pack of masks wait and save your money and buy something that is actually worth your money for years to come ,122,5.0

neutral,bought this headset in february and it stopped working no sound comes through the headset at all in april but my son didn tell me about it until july st he used it for his ps ,36,4.0
positive,a bit heavy and awkward but would expect that at this price point my only real complaint is in the cord design am using with ps and the cord splits in one is mm jack that plugs into the controller and supplies the sound which works fine the other is usb jack that supplies power to the led lights and should plug into the console the problem is that the cord splits at the last inches or so if you want to use the usb for the lights you need to either buy separate usb extension or keep your controller at least inches from your console which is very impractical if not impossible just bad design it should split much further up the cord so that both can plug in to their appropriate places at the same time had stars but lowered to because don like companies that offer money for reviews they ve been sending incessant emails saying they will refund if remove my review how about you just make decent product my integrity can be bought for ,179,5.0

positive,works great son loves it,5,5.0
neutral,the microphones too quiet,4,3.0
positive,a pretty decent headset bought this headset having very very high hopes for the mic specifically since my audio hadn been the best just through my laptop microphone but after using this headset for month or two have realized that the mic isnt actually that great it is mediocre at best and it commonly cuts out in voice calls the headset audio quality itself is honestly pretty good the mute and volume wheel were very convenient and you could really make your audio very loud with the volume wheel which was plus will say though that the led lights on the headset wont light up unless you plus the usb jack in which was big inconvenience for me when was still using wired mouse and after reading the reviews they rarely add that note but maybe just forgot to check the slides when buying this headset is also very very bulky which is personal ick for me when buying headsets its definitely not for minimalistic look but will say this is just personal preference overall its mediocre headset since its only you get what you pay for but theres definitely better headsets out there for the same price or save up just bit more money for highquality medium priced headset like the razer kraken steelseries arctics or hyperx cloud alpha headset ,221,2.0

neutral,the first headset received was busted the sound barely worked in only one ear piece so sent it back in for new one the return receiving for the new headset was easy and quick now the bad part the headset is lower quality than the description let on felt that the headset sound wasn the worst definitely step up from an earbud headset the mic however doesn past any quality test of mine have always had an easy time of speaking to my team friends but after getting this they could barely hear me they described it as if were across the room trying to speak into the mic obviously wasn was disappointed with my purchase definitely going to purchase new headset from more reputable company ,126,2.0
neutral,the headsets volume is terrible and the people you play with will barely be able to hear you even if you max the output volume on it the sound quality is also terrible as it randomly amplifies certain sounds and makes everyone sound like they are talking into cup overall dont buy this even though its cheap it is not worth as you wont be able to even function with this hunk of junk ,74,5.0

positive,this product fits like dream compared to the razer kraken line of headsets the mic isn as adjustable but prefer fixed mic as it won wear as badly and the mic quality seems comparable if not superior the cord is high quality as is the included adapter for being stock part they look just as cool as the photos aesthetically as well ,62,4.0

neutral,this product has to be plugged into the xbox and controller at the sametime to work it has about inches of cord making it impossible to play any games ,29,4.0
negative,i bought these because play rpgs via discord and wanted better mic than my galaxy buds because sometimes they don pick up my voice from the very first night used this headset people said there was an echo and they could hear themselves on my mic it was quite distracting and ended up having to switch to my earbuds thought that was weird maybe just problem with discord but would try some solutions and see if could get them to work used them little since then and no one said anything but kept myself muted unless was actually speaking then my boyfriend complained about hearing youtube through the mic to the point where it was very loud for him when could barely hear the video myself wondered if it might be my macbook pro did some research to see if there was setting could change or anything else to fix the problem nothing did then thought about seeing if other people had had the same problem by checking the reviews after reading them convinced the headset has an insane amount of noise leakage and is just bad quality all around starting the process of returning them through amazon because don have any faith that the seller will respond or offer me any satisfaction bring on the cash offers but this review is going nowhere ,224,5.0

positive,the sound quality is ok and by that mean there is some surround sound left right but not so much full directional and that pretty important to know teammates said mic sounded ok downside is the mic is short and stiff maybe that will protect it better the mic is adequate and good for the price now for the meat of this review the ear covers are stiff and tiny they wrap around my year olds ears great not mine though it actually painful to wear these longer than minutes so don plan to game long with these if you have tiny ears or are under years old then these are for you of you re an adult move on ended up spending more for razer kraken headset and omg let me tell you for the price think got the value the sound quality of the razer headset is just miles ahead of these garbage bengoos you try these trashy bengoos and then try some razer krakens with surround and you will blow your mind of the quality difference not just in sound quality but also in build quality the mic the comfort of the ear muffs just wow would have paid the price difference if knew beforehand how big difference there is between trashy cheap bengoos and actual good quality headsets like razer never going back from razer ll buy them again and again for life now that know ,240,1.0

negative,i use these headphones for my at home job as well as gaming and often get complaints from my customers that they cannot hear me actually bought these headphones to replace different pair of gaming headphones and do have less complaints about my audio with these headphones but even just one complaint is still pretty bad ,56,5.0
positive,the sound quality is decent but the mic doesn work that well so if you need mic to play with friends wouldn recommend this ,24,5.0
positive,i ve had these for about years now and they still feel and sound great good choice for standard cheap headset or general pc usepros plastic is light and flexible good for long play sessions cord is strong even after few mishaps with my chair wheel good sound quality not an expert in sound mixing but know what bad headphones sound like rarely use the mic but it functional and the mute switch still holds solidcons cord may be strong but it prone to bending in weird ways it may just be how rapped my cord around the back of my neck but it caused part of it to form rigid curve the volume control is little loose and will sometimes rise or lower if brushed against noise cancelling is effective but not perfect about what you expect though depending on what you want this could be positive led is barely feature it either takes up usb port or the plug dangles from the back of your pc or the bottom of your controller,174,5.0

positive,i ve had this headset for couple weeks so far say it is working very well sound quality is good there is no active noise cancellation but don feel that it would be necessary can hear everything clearly without turning the volume up too high the higher you go the more distortion you will hear as expected at first wasn getting the microphone to work unplugged the splitter from the single mm aux plug and re connected it after plugging both audio cables from the splitter in again everything worked as intended for those who aren familiar make sure the pink connector goes into the microphone port and green goes into the headset port this review is based on using the headset on pc have not tried using it with anything else at this time also there is toggle switch next to the volume dial on the headset make sure it is switched on microphone symbol without line through it if you plan to use the microphone overall would recommend this headset it is priced very reasonably and it meets my needs ,182,5.0

positive,the reason why bought this was because wanted better sound quality when played video games the reason why it is good is because it has good sound quality for example you can hear lot of things with the headphones like where things are say you can hear someone you know if they are on the right or the left the next reason is that it has long cord so it doesn make you lean forward when you play game for example when you use normal headphones the cord is so short that when you plug it in you have to lean forward to make sure that you can use it these headphones you have no problem the last reason is that it has the ability to connect to all devices for example you can connect it to things like pc ps xbox ect after using them think that would recommend them ,151,4.0

positive,for any headset as inexpensive as this headset its actually good one it didn have the best quality like what normally get but didn expect it to be very good it felt as if it was kind of crushing my head from the cheap foam earpiece and the foam piece that rests on top of your head didn make it that much better could only wear it for about minutes to an hour before hearing the pumping of my heart the audio wasn the best but it definitely isn the worst audio the mic is great and my friends said the only difference between my mic and this one was it was quieter the adjustable function for the headset is what disliked the most each time adjust it it always made loud cracking sound from the adjusters and each time felt as if was going to break or snap it in half because of how hard you have to pull to adjust the thing in all wouldn generally recommend this headset know it cheap option but have found lucid sound headsets or other main brand headsets as cheap as this one that have lot better quality than this one giving this one stars mainly because its cheap option for gaming but could easily give this since can find better options that are as cheap as this headset if you are looking for good headset that will last long time recommend corsair voids or just any more expensive headsets aiming around ,250,4.0

positive,i picked this up so could play the xbox games via the mobile cloud app they provide use this headset with my one controller via the plug to play the games enjoy and talk on chat playing my online games the headset fits wonderfully on my ears not too tight not loose however the ear coverings do not cancel out the noise as my other set does at home since this is an on the go out in the public headset consider this good thing as it lets me hear the close things happening around me and such the headset is light enough to not feel like giant weight on my head and feels sturdy enough to be durable for packing around in messenger bag with my phone and controller have thick vinal bag when traveling keep these in to keep them from getting damaged or dirty the sound is adequate on these don expect phenomenal quality sound like high priced headset the audio is clear and directional based on input from the games and such so can know what direction my team and enemies are in with that being said the glow feature really isn necessary but is very bright and attention getting when plugged into usb port which just runs the led lights in the earphones the bright blue would look really good on live stream or lets play if you do that sort of thing for the price paid hope these hold up with the constant going and moving around that do through the week ll come back when if they finally break fail to finish this review up and give input into the durability ,278,4.0

positive,i love the look and the lights are super cool and the sound is very nice love it,18,4.0
negative,it really nice headset was bit disappointed when found that the usb was only for the lights and that you needed the splitter for the pc sadly my laptop only has one jack so had to order another splitter just to use the new headset may have missed the description about all of that so it could be my fault it would have been nice though if the usb worked for both the lights and the headset ,77,5.0
positive,not made for ps first off you need to plug in the usb connection into separate power source to get the lights to work the sound jack that plugs in to your ps controller is split with the usb but both cords are very short so you have to choose to play with the lights off if you want to use it with the ps controller comfortably if thats the case then whats the point of owning it this is made more for laptops than ps dont recommend if you are thinking of buying it for the ps ,98,4.0

neutral,because can purchase an expensive one purchase the jbl charger don regret it love everything about it ,17,5.0
neutral,you cannot turn the speaker off without it making loud noise they know it annoying it meant to get you to install the app if you install the app giving up more of yourself to them in other words they let you turn it off think it meant to be annoying because even if you turn the volume down to and cannot hear anything else it will still make loud noise when turning off they want you to not be able to turn it off quietly for example when you were listening to some thing in bed and forgot to turn it off and later on want to turn it off quietly works fine otherwise the one star is just cause think it fair to penalize such behavior ,128,5.0
positive,sounds like gigantic speaker my daughter had one of these from amazon and loved it on her coffee table to use with tv across the room so bought it and was impressed when listening to my amazon downloaded music hubby heard it and bought himself the next version up to enhance his ipad music amazing sound from small unit we ve use it in the garage to practice our dance steps and the quality is excellent ,76,5.0

positive,i got this on sale and it was so worth it great buy ,13,1.0
positive,it could me louder but it works and sounds great volume is not that big of deal,17,5.0
positive,it an adequate speaker for this price point ll cover the points addressed in other reviews but the short version is the speaker is fine do not feel like wasted money but if when buy another of these types of speakers it won be jbl it been at least years since ve bought one of these bt speakers and my last speaker was just as loud clear cost less had features that just worked and even came with lanyard for easy carry this thing would be hard to carry for someone with small hands volume and sound quality it loud in room with no ambient noise my music is mostly rock like metallica pantera white zombie like loud music and for my private office it perfect ll mostly listen at volume so can think but it nice to jam out sometimes at middle volume level the sound is the best lows vs highs above half volume the bass tapers off and mostly just the highs are increased volume wise you could use this in an environment with ambient noise like warehouse or kitchen but you would need to stay around if you want to really enjoy what is playing after it probably going to sound more like noise than music phone connectivity is simple for music just push top button but not automatic for phone calls like it was with my other speaker had in the price point there are some reviews that cover troubleshooting this the manual certainly is no help but it not what needed it for just liked it as nice side feature used sometimes with my last speaker like this battery life is fine haven done complete testing on this it does have pretty significant battery in it for the charge your device option but hrs maybe at the lowest volume playing nice simple music won need it for longer than hrs most of the time so doubt this will come up as an issue for me there an app but it does very little for this speaker most useful feature is digital copy of the horrible instructions that come with the speaker thankfully for it main function of bt connecting and playing music it pretty basic and simple if you go the route of multiple speakers reads the reviews for the app on how to make that work it is not intuitive it series of linear steps which the instructions do not help with and if you do it wrong all kinds of weird issues were reported in the reviews ,425,5.0

positive,i spend lot of time working with music esp mixing mastering composing wanted speaker could enjoy while was at the skatepark my friends something that could get loud and sound really good heard jbl was pretty popular and had good reputation but was dissappointed with the charge in terms of build quality it nice speaker it feels sturdy and looks good but as soon as turned on song was shocked by the quality of audio the mid frequencies were boosted and they made audio sound muddy and unpleasant for speaker that was real letdown checked out their app hoping for some sort of software update tune up but it very bare bones and didn have anything to help also checked if bass mode was on and it was from the start went into my phone eq settings and manually changed the spectrum to my liking if you own this speaker recommend you moderately raise the lows duck the mids and raise the highs that made the speaker lot more pleasant but as soon as did that it took loss on its max volume the skatepark go to is pretty small but has metal ramps that get loud this speaker wasn enough for the park it definitely okay if you re at small picnic in an apartment etc but it doesn get as loud as was hoping overall this speaker isn worth the price for an allegedly reputable brand it absurd the sound quality doesn come good from the start it felt like paid for jbl logo what think ll do is buy from cheaper brand and do the eq tuning myself hope this helps have good week ,277,1.0

positive,unlike most people who use speakers like this for fun used it for work as fedex express courier not only did our bigger trucks not have working climate controls arm rests cruise control or insulation from the elements we don have speakers imagine hours on the road in loud tin can shaking and rattling every which way with no music to soothe your stress so one night decided no more of that this speaker fit right into the passengers seat and would strap the seatbelt just incase the trucks had world class terrible suspension the smallest bump in the road would send anything not strapped down flying with that at full volume in the truck that battery might last around or hours but man oh man on full volume it would tune out the road noise tin can truck doors rattling against the metal body everything it made my driving experience so much better that being said would only need full volume on the highway did you know express trucks are governed to mph well assuming our trucks could even easily reach that at least in my station they all had check engine lights and once timed that it took seconds to go from mph to mph fun and when was driving from mph having the speaker at was fine at that rate could make it last about hours before needing recharge thank jbl for creating such great speaker and frankly am sure their other products have that battery capacity needed but got this on sale and it fit right into my backpack for the situation was in it was total game changer went from messy stressy anger to happily singing along to my favorite songs on the off chance another courier reads this making it your routine to turn the speaker off on your way out the door will save battery will have fond memories of driving down my route playing music and singing my heart out for those precious few moments where the stress was pushed to the back of my mind luckily do not work there anymore and this speaker will not see daily use but when needed it my life was much better for it it sat next to an open door in an isuzu reach and never moved centimeter providing me with amazing sound all the while know now anything and everything might throw at it will never take it down if battery life is your concern it is valid if you want the best sound for the size of the speaker this is hard to beat and it has my doing deliveries in tin can with an open door on road at mph still sounding good seal of approval ,455,5.0

positive,so originally was introduced to jbl speakers when the charge first came out loved it and was immediately fan and remain to be fast forward to have been telling any and everyone come across that when ever in question go with jbl so this last christmas someone baught me the jbl flip and was just confused the sound quality the base even the bluetooth connection would kick me off about every third song returned no problem only wanted replacement anyway received the second one and again like the jbl look and feel was there but the sound quality especially the base was just lacking was disappointed thinking that the company just dived after the charge so after getting refund from the second flip spent think it was an extra dollar and there it was the sound that made me fan to begin with if you re just trying out jbl speakers would recommend spending just the few extra dollars for the charge models see that the flip and have almost perfect rating on amazon so maybe it just my opinion but believe the quantity all around of the charge is better representative of the jbl brand the battery in the charge seems to drain quicker than the flip but put my speaker threw it passes from the moment turn it on in the morning until am ready to relax in the evening literally have nothing negative to say about the bluetooth connection no problem at all the sound quality is just awesome love music period believe music is the best and purist way to control moods mentally emotionally spiritually and even physically listen to anything from gospel to heavy metal blues country rap etc have noticed that if the music being listened to is heavy in base the lyrics will be more clear if you just lower the volume maybe or pushes of the button if you re listening to sax or blues guitar albert king for example it only gets better the higher you go garth brooks or lauren daigle just over half way of volume and the vocals and piano will be front and center and so on even at just little more than half way more than what you would need in the back patio or yard man can wait till can get enough for the extreme or the boom box hope this was helpful to someone god bless,402,5.0

negative,i finally pulled the plug and purchased this speaker and received april the sound was just ok it didn cover the whole house as would have loved the speaker when out october it didn even last year believe it was due to shortage in the port noticed earlier on that the flap to hide the power ports pushed up against the cord while plugged so my guess is that it finally got destroyed this is very disappointing given the fact that it is still fairly new now have to spend more money on new speaker the next time will go ahead and invest in the warranty ,106,5.0

positive,just got this so not sure how it will hold up over time it was very well packaged could have drop kicked it without damage arrived within stated range the speaker was nearly fully charged charging was as easy as attaching usb came with usb cable but no adapter got plenty of those so actually happy about the non duplication bluetooth pairing with my android phone was quick and easy sound is bit base heavy but is rich and full no buzz even when cranked easily filling room it looks well built and based on my inspection could probably withstand complete submersion so far very happy if it continues to perform well will buy another one or more and link them for more intense sound experience the intended use of this speaker is relatively humid wine cellar ,137,3.0

neutral,this product was well worth the money,7,5.0
positive,i bought this and originally gave it perfect review because the sound quality is great but the actual quality is not after less than days it quit charging and quit working called amazon who offered refund when purchased it it was they told me they would refund me and then could order new one and now they are when it worked it works great but it just did not last long on amazon did not really do any favors with replacing sure the reason they did not replace it is because the price has gone up or the sale is over asked for replacement and they told me no they gave me refund and told me to re order so that they instead so sure they can make more money not happy and very unimpressed do not recommend buying the speaker through amazon because amazon seems to be the crappy one here go buy it at costco who will honor the same price and replace it ,166,5.0

neutral,i bought this about months ago and it worked perfect in the course of normal use turned it off and then went to plug it in immediately after noticed the unit wouldnt charge and proceeded to try several other chargers to no avail since product is slightly more than year old jbl is offering to give me the names of local repair shops that can pay out of pocket to fix this shoddy workmanship for premium product that is more than likely designed to break after warranty so you ll have to buy another just dont get how it can work and after turning if off while working it would proceed to never turn on again if you want to throw away every year then this is the perfect speaker for you was offered discount on future speaker but that is not the answer wanted or expected ,147,5.0

positive,great sound quality and volume ,5,1.0

positive,this thing is terrific it has shocking amount of bass for small speaker jbl pretty much nailed the design if were to complain it would be that the base is little narrow use the speaker by my pool and dont want to bump the speaker and it roll into the pool again for you people that are complaining about it being mono its an engineering choice to deliver performance in other areas do you have to have stereo drivers that will be inches apart is that really needed of course not if that bothers you there are ton of other devices that might be better fit but doubt it will deliver as well in the other areas have an old bt stereo speaker and it does not come close to delivering sound on par with the charge going mono delivers more volume longer battery lower heat and simplified controls bass sucks power this thing gets pretty damn loud and really delivers ton of bass stream to it in the backyard when swimming in the pool it has really been great it has been accidentally kicked into the pool few times but no damage and it has proven to be water resistant as advertised ,203,5.0

positive,if you are buying this most probably you have done your research and for me it lives up to its expectation the speaker delivers deep bass for something of its size and is loud enough to fill large room if you want to use it outdoors it will definitely get the neighbors wondering if you re having party it gets pretty loud without getting distorted and at around is when there is sound distortion great for movie night in bed and for listening to music having owned the flip twice this is definitely an upgrade especially with its charging but wish it had strap or handle like the bigger and smaller versions of this speaker and wish it had microphone sometimes but also understand why they didn include it on here ,131,5.0

positive,decent speaker nothing revelatory but the form factor is great it gets the noise out there effectively pros battery life feels like it infinite bluetooth connectivity is the best ve ever experienced handsome unit cons thuddy sound but some of that is bluetooth some of that is streaming some of that is the fact that it not very big overall effectively fills the sonic gap between my home speakers and my laptop which is what it was meant for ,79,5.0

positive,an attractive high performing speaker that exceeded my expectations first the bad news did have difficulty at first pairing my phone with the speaker the included instructions were no help and would have liked to see bit more detail it just series of what look like comic book panels begrudgingly downloaded the jbl portable app found bit more information and was able to pair straight out of the box the sound is bit disappointing the speaker did not produce much bass and was really heavy in the upper midrange and high frequencies would highly recommend downloading an equalizer app on your music source device now the good news the equalizer made this speaker come alive volume for days and more bass that would have expected for speaker this size the fact that it can also charge your music source device is even more reason to select this speaker ,148,5.0

positive,someone gave me charge bought charge thinking could pair them nope so bought another charge pairing is difficult if you desire stereo sound as opposed to two mono speakers had to get second jbl app and attempt to import my music into it some of which won play when do get it to play in stereo it doesn stay that way for long the hardware software combo has been finicky and temperamental for me also amazon is not letting me add an informative photo ,84,5.0
positive,amazing,1,5.0
positive,love it so far got it was basically fully charged and played all day at the pool barely saw any decrease in power love the sound and the good bass able to control sound eq via the settings on my phone for those recognizing it doesn seem to have an eq in an app or something we are stepping up from the jbl clip which is also really great just doesn have the volume we wanted for patio or at the pool fills locker room full of sound easy too able to listen at low volume and still have full depth of sound many commented about the mono sound aspect but honestly love this sound it full and the highs mids are pronounced with clarity no distortion my only nit is that it definitely will muffle if like towel is over it or something not really worth knocking my rating tho had it in my sport bag and could notice decrease in clarity solid purchase very happy with it ,169,5.0

positive,luv this speaker was disappointed when received it cause it looked small and thought how such speaker of this size could satisfy me but then hooked it up and wow downloaded an equalizer app from the google store and now have full control on my listening pleasures and great sounds can control the sounds thru my tablet the speaker itself and the equalizer app all three have volume control truly not sorry bought this speaker take it with me hook it up in the trunk of my car and the sound just resonates with the truck door open the enclosure of the car trunk makes the sound incredible great buy ,110,2.0
positive,took it to work with me few times and had my job feeling like club with how much base it pumps out and the sound is crisp and clean ,29,5.0
positive,i am blown away at how poor this product truly is at first thought it didn work at all because there was no sound but apparently half charge is not enough for there to be sound but once it was fully charged it worked once getting the product working turned on some music and the amount of bass ruined the music had to download an equalizer app just to get the music to even sound decent and not crackle took it to work the next day with full charge and went to use it and again no sound turned it off and took it home still with full battery went to try it again few days later and the battery was drained even though it had been turned off overall am impressed with not one thing about this speaker and you are proud to charge as much as you do for this product have better success buying one from the dollar store do not buy ,165,2.0

neutral,the user guide and charge cable did not come it was supposed to ,13,3.0
neutral,like everything about it,4,5.0
positive,let me start with what everyone is most interested in these have great sound quality for the size they have better bass than you expect but the treble could be little stronger ve turned the volume way up just to see how they handle the power and they hold up well you can blast them without worry as long as you have good source material bought so could output in stereo it bit quirky trying to get them into stereo mode but it does work however for some reason they glitch occasionally which causes dropout when playing in stereo think it has to do with the bluetooth communication between speakers hoping they can come up with firmware update to fix it don have this problem when just using speaker all in all would recommend buying these ,136,1.0
neutral,gift for grandson,3,5.0

positive,ya know for almost thought be more impressed sound quality isn bad but the bass interferes with the sound quality and makes it wobbly to where scared to play it loud ue doesn do that like others mentioned too it is mono speaker which isn great when looking for full directional quality sound,53,5.0
positive,i bought this for our wrestling room which is very large and this just isn quite big enough for that do however like the sound and feel it is very good speaker just know that it isn for large area ,40,1.0
positive,this is great speaker light and easy to work basic controls that get the job done with no confusion ordered carry strap for it from amazon as well must get the carry strap for hanging and protection gave it out of for sound quality it delivers more bass than treble great speaker for the money claims to have hr battery based on use and is waterproof can touch that plenty loud for the beach or backyard,76,2.0
positive,this speaker is awesome was bit skeptical about the passive radiators but was impressed it doesn pump bass as much as wired speaker such as echo plus but the sound is still excellent and the battery life is great usually play music off and on during my workweek and charge it once per week gave it stars due to the poor usb implementation the speaker charges through its usb port however it is only able to output power to act like powerbank and charge phone for example through its usb port my recommendation to jbl is to ditch the usb port entirely and use the usb port for charging and power output ,112,5.0
positive,love this thing sounds great good bass for small unit very satisfied ,12,5.0
positive,i bought refurbished one but it looked brand new and untouched so saved few bucks and that was good the green color is cool much cooler than black which was my second more expensive choice it connected immediately almost to my ipad iphone macbook the sound is great it very loud but don play it that loud yet bought it to use outdoors for music so expect it will work well paired with an iphone it simple compact device but it delivers great sound could not be happier and it waterproof which hope never to test but it nice to know because it will be outside and might get left outdoors overnight on occasion battery life seems fine so far but have only used it for few hours time will tell on that one ,134,1.0

positive,this was pandemic lockdown buy my wife and were spending lot of time outside on our patio our happy hours were missing something great sounds this speaker delivers great sound at low mid and high range it can also play very loud although we keep the volume pretty low to be respectful of our neighbors would recommend this speaker to friend ,61,4.0
positive,i ve had this speaker for well over year now use it full volume in the shower while its soaking wet and also outside on the patio ve had it connected to my smaller tv that move between porch and patio but my sony works better for that due to the sony app to control the volume via bluetooth being much better than the jbl app it still looks and works as good as when first got it battery lasts good amount of time and it has incredible bass for its size especially if its placed against wall or better yet in an inside corner have been very happy with its quality and performance now some negative aspects the battery level indicator lights are placed very low so they are not visible in most cases and then the unit just goes dead with no warning when the charge runs out the base is small compared to the speaker so it can easily roll over and off table if bumped speakers are on the ends so you can stand it up vertical it does make loud melodic sound when turned off it is pretty rugged and waterproof so the addition of case adds no value is just another useless item cluttering your life and is environmentally negative suggest getting one without the case the current price is much much more percent more than when purchased it maybe due to covid price gouging or just rampant inflation never buy used product that requires built in battery as someone is unloading it because its defective or reached its end of life even if it still looks like new ,275,5.0

negative,the aux input doesn work properly the sound keeps cutting out this is simply bad design and when contacted jbl support about this here was their official response our jbl charge normally goes on standby when there is no sound coming out of the speaker for while this feature can be turned off they called their poor design feature much in the same way faulty brakes on car is feature they also solicited me for star review and incentivized me with gift card so stars ,85,5.0

positive,practically all bluetooth speakers are mono it has nothing to do with how many drivers speakers cones it has to get stereo sound you usually need to have two of the same or typically at least the same brand bluetooth speaker and send different audio right or left to each one the charge had two forward facing mid high range drivers driven by same signal so they effectively acted as one driver speaker charge replaced the two forward facing drivers with single larger higher quality forward facing driver that produces better depth and definition at least in my opinion ll take the charge over the charge or the flip any day ,111,5.0

positive,i use this product all day and the battery only gets down to half it sounds great and is easy to use ,22,5.0
positive,first of all the speaker is monaural and you need two to get stereo that then you need an app to convince the speakers to play in stereo and there is no app for windows or mac only mobile devices tried an android emulator but you can get to bluetooth that way so forget it the app is crappy too it takes at least two tries each time to convince the speakers to play in stereo and the app has to be left running after while something times out the sound reverts to monaural and the app has to be closed and re started to make it stereo again the only reason this speaker gets so many good reviews is that apparently most people don care about stereo sound what waste so good sound or not these are going back both of them ,143,5.0

positive,i have owned this speaker for year now and still love it pros great volume and sound some of the best bass have experienced from bluetooth portable speaker very durable forgot the speaker on the top of my car at one point and this device finally fell off at around mph onto blacktop and bounced down the road thought had just completely ruined my jbl but other than some superficial scuffing nothing was damaged have used the speaker to play music in the rain and there were no issues the battery typically lasts over hours with easecons the volume tends to be to loud the volume makes big jumps when clicked so occasionally just can hit that sweet spot it also doesn go low enough for quiet study music at least for me ,133,4.0

positive,jbl as you know prides itself on high quality sound this company far exceeds anyone expectations when it comes to great sounding audio and solid build quality the jbl charge is very rugged and tough water proof speaker that really delivers on high quality sound this portable speaker is great for any party no matter the type and it works great with any genre of music when purchased this speaker already knew what was getting because had heard this speaker inside church where they had of them going all connected together and quite frankly they sounded like very expensive sound system and due to the wide expanse of the church sancturary the bass resonated very well from the music and all the mids and highs were also there there isn bit of speaker hiss or distortion from these speakers no matter how many are connected oh let me tell you about stereo mode now that is really sweet jbl really knew what they were doing when they implemented stereo mode for these speakers because let me tell you the stereo mode makes the music quite emerssive and realistic jbl sound signature is great and it definitely deserves star reward for excellence and quality the fact that you can connect of these together means that you can have sound all around you if you like believe me you ll be amazed at the bass that these little guys put out and the great stereo mode when connecting two of them together listen to all genres of music but my favorites are edm house and trance as well as country and soft rock edm music really bangs on these you will have your own version of the clubs when you use these speakers other genres of music sound great on them as well thanks to jbl signature sound which is extremely clear and detailed without any distortion whatsoever and since today music is all digital you need that kind of sound because nothing else will do the jbl charge speakers are definitely star in my book and urge everybody to get pair or of them if you can afford it haha as far as comparison between other similar speakers these put bose to shame matter of fact they blow bose clear out of the water bose ain got nothing on these speakers guaranteed now sony is good runner up but sony has small problem with sounding little muffled in my opinion actually own the jbl boombox and that monster really cranks out the bass and it is very loud the charge speakers are also very loud too for their size which is why am so impressed with them also love the fact that they have an ipx rating which means that you can put them in the water yes you can use these speakers in your shower you could take shower in stereo yep totally water proof stereo now isn that something hey if you had smart phone that was also water proof the entire stereo system could go in the shower with you haha hmmm new adult pool toy your water proof stereo so if were you would get these bad boys today and let the party begin ,537,1.0

neutral,i got my jbl charge and it worked well until the battery died and then it would not let me charge do not buy ,24,5.0
positive,what can say this is hands down the best waterproof portable bluetooth speaker ve ever owned and ve had few jbl has household name for reason and rightly so the sound is amazing especially the bass great range and even better battery life the fact that you can charge your device from it is awesome but the link feature has to be my favorite aspect link with your friends who have the same family of speakers with one button for multi source audio ve got few friends with them and it always enhances the experience also more than one device can pair simultaneously which is super neat highly recommended ,109,5.0

positive,just what expected better than most cheap under portable bluetooth speakers as far as sound quality goes its just ok honestly was hoping it had better sound quality but it doesnt but for portable battery powered bluetooth speakers it meets expectations for the price low frequencies bass is ok mid frequencies are ok and high frequencies treble are also just ok would have preferred they made it not waterproof and had better sound quality don really care if it waterproof or not especially if that feature is going to sacrifice the sound quality,93,5.0
neutral,bought this to replace little ue that had this speaker has no bass no mids its loudest volume is nothing compared to my much smaller speaker returning this after one day ,31,5.0
positive,charge has been great so far sounds great battery life after full charge is very good days until recharge if that bluetooth connectivity is reliable portable ,26,5.0
positive,excellent music box for both sound quality and product quality nice looking too easy to carry around ,17,3.0
neutral,very fine bluetooth speaker once again jbl builds quality product ,10,4.0
neutral,the aux on the jbl charge is poorly designed the speaker will turn off between songs or podcasts if there is delay extended silence or short period of low volume section causing parts of the song to missed for few seconds while it tries to turn back on this creates interruptions if you are trying to listen to yoga or meditative music or podcasts have two of them with the latest firmware and they both have this issue it appears many others have already commented on this issue apparently this was an intentional design by jbl to save power but it defeats the purpose of the aux port the bluetooth range and party range is mediocre you can leave the room with your phone or it will cut out ,129,2.0
positive,its great good sound quality and style ,7,1.0
negative,i ve had this speaker for about months and everything is great with it but really irritated because one of the sub speakers have blown this was pretty expensive speaker and now that that blew it sounds really bad,39,5.0

positive,everything about rhis speaker love you get what you pay for is true here bought few different ones and borrows few friends speakers and compared them all and this one is well worth the cost the volume and sound range and clarity was noticeably better with this speaker compared to all the others the battery life is great ve had it at of max volume for about hours and it shows of leds lit highly recommend this to anyone looking for powerful portable speaker,84,5.0

positive,love it,2,5.0
neutral,battery and charge functions step up from next model down in the jbl bluetooth speakers sound appears to be same quality as model below this one heavier than lower model bigger because of battery if you don need the features of the battery and charge options go with next model down in the jbl bluetooth speakers and save and less bulky,61,5.0
positive,over all is very good if you ask love stereo sound ,11,5.0
positive,the jbl charge is awesome the sound is incredible the battery life is amazing ,14,5.0
positive,i have had the jbl charge for while the sound is good and what you would expect from portable waterproof battery powered bluetooth speaker anyone who expects studio quality sound from the aforementioned probably truly believes the president they voted for in is as great as he thinks he is however there is one flaw in the charge that no matter the sound quality or anything else will end the usefulness of this device the charging port for the charge is type and if you don get the cable in the port perfectly every time it becomes damaged to the point of being useless you are then left with pounds of useless junk jbl for this type of product how about more substantial charging port btw what will you give me for lbs of junk ,135,5.0

negative,battery life is great being able to use it as charger for other devices like to charge cell phone also major plus but where it suffers is the sound quality as others have mentioned the mono speaker is definitely weak point though the bass output is decent for its size the speaker barely seems to get as loud as our flip also when connected via bluetooth to our samsung tv for is quite noticeable lag in audio once again in comparison to the flip ,84,5.0
positive,very happy with item all of our teens have this speaker and they all love them,16,1.0
positive,it is great product much larger then the flip from jbl about times the size,15,5.0
negative,i have never dropped it or damaged it in any way it barely leaves its shelf never listen on full volume yet the quality turned to absolute poopoo within the past year noticed it actually after months and it been getting worse the highs and mids sound sooo muddled and it hurts my ears because listen to rock metal electronic edm and others which are heavy on the percussion and need really good quality sound or it can be heavy on the ears literally appalled going to try to get it fixed by jbl hopefully they ll pull through and fix it because really sad and can return it anymore ahh ,111,5.0

neutral,speaker stopped accepting charge after two weeks continuously shutdown after minute of use returned accordingly ,15,1.0
positive,the photo compares the flip smaller and charge larger the charge is well worth the extra it louder more bass and much much crisper sound the flip sounds just like the wonderboom which is fine but not for really enjoying the range of sound of your music haven purchased any other bluetooth speakers so can speak on how these compare to bose or other more expensive brands for my needs in bedroom apartment of these in the bedroom kitchen and bathroom works nicely very easy to connect battery life is amazing does take time to charge but plays and charges at the same time they connected to one another easily ,110,5.0
positive,i listen to everything from podcasts to classical rock and metal on this speaker it has great full range including an impressive bass response the treble is pretty directional and the sound isn hi fi for critical listening very happy with the small size and portability can carry this thing around the house or back yard and have my music wherever go overall very satisfied ,65,1.0

positive,love love love this thing even at low volumes it has full range of sound own an older bose sound link mini whose sound it also superb but this charge has far louder range bought it for around the home use and our annual trips to the philippines where things tend to get wet on the beach being quite waterproof that shouldn be an issue with the charge the bluetooth connects easily and quickly no toggling on and off to get it to work as with some older bluetooth speakers haven used it long enough but the battery shouldn be any sort of problem at all since it mah which means it allowed on planes overall extremely pleased ,118,5.0

positive,has deep bass but wouldn mind bit more treble it sounds great outdoors and that without turning the volume all the way up did have some trouble setting up the stereo mode but figured it out we play this whenever we shower plus when we re getting ready and we charge it like every three weeks or so it only takes an hour or two to fully chargefor stereo mode pause the music and make sure only one speaker is connected via bluetooth press the connect button on both with the app open it ll show both speakers together and you can tap stereo below it it will not work if both speakers are connected via bluetooth it has to be just one and leave the other unpaired,128,5.0

positive,i live in the country and host or go to lot of bonfires and outdoor gatherings we discovered while ago that having radio wasn good enough between lack of music selection and constant commercials the jbl charge is perfect party speaker solution and going to leave my impressions based on that use the speaker is plenty loud if you re on deck patio and it placed several feet away you ll even need to turn it down to have normal conversation it doesn do as well at our large outdoor fire pit because of the bigger distances and lack of surroundings to close sound in that space is about feet from bench on one side of the fire pit to the other and in an open yard the speaker is still good just not great if you like loud commanding music as do if there is larger group of people like speaking at once for example it will not be able to overtake their voices and will be reduced to background music it will also be affected by big bonfire the waves of heat will actually distort the sound on the opposite side of the fire the sound clarity is good bass is nothing crazy but tight and does not distort or sound hollow as noted earlier volume really depends on how small space you re using it in and how many people are talking but even in the big open outdoor area it perfectly loud with only few people most importantly when turned all the way up it maintains clear clean sound and does not get distorted like other sound systems speakers do when you push them see some complaints about it being mono speaker but it sounds fine to me for what it is if want unparalleled sound eq customization and other features ll buy true audiophile equipment bluetooth is easy to connect and lifesaver technology in general if you have cellphone with enough bars and this speaker you can play as much music as you want bluetooth will stay connected at good distance ve walked about feet from the speaker and had no issues not many people would be streaming music very far away from the speaker imagine but it will tolerate reasonable distance charge time is definitely optimistic it advertised as being hours but ve not gotten close to that fully charged and playing continuously at full volume connected via bluetooth ve squeezed probably hours out of it which is still plenty often just let it charge from an outdoor outlet while playing music the speaker is definitely waterproof ve left it outside in the rain couple of times also let it sit on plastic chair with recess on the bottom it rained overnight and came out the next morning to find it submerged about an inch or so in puddle of water where it had sat for hours powered right up with no issues glad tested its abilities but hate to abuse neglect any of my stuff like that if you re doing something similar to me gathering several friends around chimenea on the patio or sitting out back by the fire pit this speaker is awesome and will be louder than you want when cranked up if you re looking to entertain large group of people who are going to be noisy it not the best choice but who really listening at that point anyway ,571,1.0

positive,very skeptical at the beginning did lots of research on competitors let be honest this is not going to replace total sound system if that what you are dreaming of but this speaker goes from room to room and outside and gives sound that is of high enough quality for you not to feel like you are missing out on something better bought this for family member first saw how good it was then bought one for myself within the same week battery life is great would definitely recommend this ,90,2.0

positive,this product is amazing the color looks great and stands out battery life is impressive only problem and reason not to give atar is the fact this product doesn include the plug in ac usb port only the cable ,39,2.0
negative,the sound isn as good as had hoped but the awful range of the bluetooth was the absolute deal breaker fully charged it can keep solid bluetooth connection to my computer that literally feet across the living room it breaks up so bad that it was unbearable to listen to wondering if the problem was actually my computer switched to little jbl clip that have and it worked flawlessly the charge was total failure and is being returned to best buy ,81,5.0

positive,this is very good little system for the price holds charge for long time and sounds really good at reasonable volume,21,4.0
positive,i bought like new speaker but before made my purchase contacted the seller and basically asked why the product was classified as like new their response item is inspected and functional there day return period took chance the only reason didn give star rating is because my speaker arrived very poorly packed consider myself lucky the speaker is of such superior quality durability because delivery people don make habit of handling packages carefully and the protection provided amounted to some shredded foam from an original box thrown in regular shipping box with the packing bubble wrap everything had shifted in shipping there was no effort to secure the bits of packing material to protect the unit and it arrived with no user manual or operating instructions of any kind had to go on youtube for tutorial and to jbl site for manual download so stars for the product itself actually give the shipper stars but don want the overall rating to reflect poorly on the product itself jbl is the truth ,171,5.0
positive,powerful speaker great sound,4,5.0
neutral,doesn hold charge lasted however long the battery was charged for initially and that was it ,16,1.0

positive,in my opinion if you dive too deep into youtube reviews regarding decibel comparisons etc etc you ll never end up buying any speaker keeping it simple can tell you this is an awesome portable speaker for it price range take it to the community pool bbq outdoor family events and it perfect long lasting battery good bluetooth connectivity and packs pretty good punch in both volume and bass would maybe consider the larger jbl xtreme if it goes on sale but in all honesty this charge is perfect for what use it for portability to me is more important that little higher volume and bass love the speaker well done jbl ,112,5.0
negative,i ve had my speaker for about months now the cord got really messed up and stopped charging the speaker and it would take days to get it to of the charging bubbles fully had it charging the whole day and it only got to bubble icon fully ,48,5.0

neutral,can pair any device because the bluetooth button is not working ,11,5.0
positive,this is great speaker with great battery life and great bluetooth connectivity to our samsung and chromebook and the jbl app does firmware updates over bluetooth love it the reason for losing one star is its charging behavior bought this to have it in one location constantly connected to charger and to only carry it around from time to time running on battery for some reason the speaker charges fully the leds indicating the battery level go out to indicate that it fully charged but then after some time the leds turn on again and the th led starts blinking to indicate that it charging and stays that way all this while the speaker sits there connected to the charger without being turned on the leds are very bright which makes it more annoying ,134,4.0

positive,i generally don give five stars unless it something extremely love but this little bar of sound is totally awesome amazing extremely worth the money this tiny little bluetooth speaker is amazing it super small but the sound is pretty loud it very portable and you don have to constantly be charging it even at max volume we have two big sony speakers that can light up party they re also wireless but they re extremely heavy and take up lot of space and they are way too loud for public reunions so we decided to get this jbl portable speaker and it was the best thing we did it portable because we could take it camping to the beach or pool or lake and the sound is great and even if you drop it in water or juice it continues to work amazingly ,144,5.0
neutral,bought for my son as present it fit the bill and was actually more than he expected did price comparison and it beat the competition hands down ,27,5.0

neutral,several years ago purchased pair of jbl charge speakers to use around our pool and was immediately in love would connect one to my phone and then link the pair and have nice even sound all across our pool the range was great the sound was great and the batteries lasted long time we eventually wore the batteries out and decided to replace them with pair of jbls latest charge speakers the charge the sound quality and other features are the same but the instability and sensitivity of the bluetooth connection and link feature are so bad they are unusable have to have my phone within feed of the speaker for the bluetooth to connect and they constantly cut out loose their connection to each other or pick up static it is so persistent we are not using them anymore deeply regret buying these speakers and wish would have spent less money to but the far superior charge speakers again if you plan to connect two or more speakers together stay away from these because they just don work ,179,5.0
positive,this is great device easy to setup and use right out of the box excellent sound am using it outside as work on big construction project makes the work go much easier ,32,1.0
positive,great speaker provides good sound and lasts long time the reason for the star deduction is because the battery didn last as long as advertised took it on float trip and it died about hours in granted had it turned up max the entire time and it was hot day but think it should have lasted longer also the sound on the float wasn as loud as would have liked it was incredibly sturdy and portable no complaints there ,79,3.0

positive,i have flip and this charge ive played both and im little disappointed with the charge my flip has stereo speakers and frankly sounds just as good if not even better then my charge its weird the flip sounds amazing from low volume to almost highest volume where the charge doesn sound as nice at low volume but will keep up at higher levels almost pushing out about the same volume as its smaller sibling flip the only thing consider the charge to have over the flip is it doesn get too distorted at max volume like the flip but the flip just sounds great almost at any level but at max maybe little less bass on the flip too but not by much im beginning to regret my charge purchase wish just went with new flip and see how that works out btw used the charge for hotel room bluetooth soundbar since live in hotels while working each month so good sound means lot to me especially when get noise complaints from the host ,175,5.0

negative,we purchased this product because we heard good things about it however the battery stopped taking charge after about months we filed warranty claim and after many emails and several hours of our time sorting things out we were told there was nothing they could do because the item was manufactured the prior year and they do not go by the date of purchase ridiculous the offered coupon to buy something else from them but obviously we will not be buying their products in the future very disappointed ,88,5.0

neutral,i rarely write reviews but this little bluetooth speaker from jbl is gem ve got high end setup in the family room and picky about sound it hard to believe the depth and bass from this little guy it actually projects decent soundstage too it on my desk and improving the quality of my days at work crank it up between calls bluetooth connect is instant and battery life very long take it out when grilling and hanging the yard very portable and gets loud without distortion how did jbl do this ,92,5.0
neutral,i bought jbl speakers which had high reviews did not know needed to install an app to get them in stereo installed the app confirmed by google play store and cant find it on my computer went to jbl video on youtube for help and they want me to watch two video ads first no thank you this is way too complicated update dont know how this product averages stars have two units that no longer use as went back to wired speakers aaaaaaaaaaaahhhh hear that that is the sound of me no longer being frustrated by wireless speakers the bluetooth lag is simply unacceptable once you figure how to pair the speakers in stereo then you have to press button on each speaker every time you want stereo there is only one active speaker in each unit the battery on one of the units never fully charges takes very long time to charge them if you lived close to me then would give them to you for free no longer want them ,173,1.0

neutral,update downgrading from stars to jbl has terrible customer service at best if you have questions no one will help this comes with usb cord only nothing to charge to wall outlet if you want to hear text message sound notification through your speaker forget it the original jbl charge does allow message sound notifications you have to have your phone next to you constantly which totally defeats the purpose it step back will be returning this very disappointed ,79,1.0

positive,i was debating between this speaker and the ultimate ears megaboom my friend actually bought the ue megaboom at the same time bought the jbl charge can say this speaker has more bass and is louder in volume prefer the directional speakers on this there is front where sound is clearer and louder and back don love how there isn strap or loop or something to grip but did buy really cool silicone case for that has strap and doesn alter the sound ,83,1.0

positive, first of all the price of this speaker is cheap for the quality sound that your getting this speaker sounds amazing the build quality is great and the fact that is waterproof and you can charge your phone from it is an added bonus so happy got it the only downside to me and this is just me being picky and annoying is that can see the battery percentage on my iphone but it does show it on the bottom of the speakers with little led dots get this speaker you wont regret it ,94,5.0
neutral,bought this speaker for my dad who is an expert in car audio and he was impressed in the quality and volume this speaker has ,25,5.0
positive,i like this speaker crisp clear sound with nice bass the only misleading part for me was the hr playtime after hours on moderate volume it was down to the nd to last light and it also says you can have something charging as well thru the usb highly doubt would have lot of battery in doing so nothing different in battery longevity compared to my other non jbl speakers except better sound ,73,3.0

negative,bass is weak volume is low no way to adjust this was more than the oontz angle bt speaker that got three years ago and it not better at all holding down the bt button with the button simply causes the speaker to unpair and power down these are not helpful don waste your money on this if you re looking for anything other that very poor bass and it overheats like snowflake in the sun so if you want to take it to the beach don just don buy this ,91,5.0
neutral, bought this on sale at target because needed it at that moment great sound quality just disappointed it mono and not stereo ,22,4.0

positive,i am looking for more than decent little camping speaker haven run the battery down completely only listening to it for about hours first thing noticed listening to few different types of music is that it got little to no low end you start to lose everything at around hz not looking to blow the doors off of anything but want little more than this can give the build quality feels super sturdy and it gets pretty loud for its size it can definitely fill my studio apartment ,88,5.0

positive,this speaker has been nice upgrade from the standard dollar speaker you can get anywhere the sound is rich and it does have good bass can why others stated some of the voice gets drowned out at times but enough to deter me from not buying this speaker overall the sound is great and can get decently loud the color got was sand and it looks great one thing that does not make sense to me is they dont give power cord dont recall the last time ve spent this much on an electronic that didnt come with accessory that is as important as that all in all like it and very pleased with my purchase ,116,1.0

positive,i have small bluetooth speaker and was looking for one bit bigger for an upcoming trip wanted something that could fill living room and kitchen with some decent sound first bought the soundcore flare and while liked the sound and eq settings on the app it just didn fill the room with full sound the jbl might be bit narrower on the soundstage the overall quality and low end were enough to seal the deal also like you can connect two devices at once the charge has nice heft to it and the construction is solid definitely feel like got my money worth pros solid bass even sound quality construction connect two devices at once battery life seems good usb port for charging the speakercons soundstage bit narrow app has no eq settings,133,5.0
neutral,the product was toy junk false advertisment,7,1.0
positive,great sound quality amazing battery and lightweight ,7,5.0
neutral,while the overall sound is decent for the price bought two speakers specifically for the party feature which is supposed to allow two or more of the same speakers to connect and play together ve had nothing but problems with that feature ve tried resetting per company instructions even sent them back and got two new speakers but the same problems exist if you want one speaker go right ahead but would advise against getting more than one ,78,5.0
positive,whereas on the charge the bass gets bit overwhelming on the charge the bass feels non existant by comparison further sound on the charge is less clear than on the charge details in your music get off faint notes disappear although the bass on the charge could be overwhelming the overall sound quality was much better further the charge is heavier bulkier than the charge despite less functionality on the charge could make phone calls but there is no calling ability on the charge if the charge upgraded its bluetooth to be better compatible with more modern devices would trash the charge and go back to the charge the only improvement on the charge over the charge is that the power button is bit easier to press ,127,4.0

positive,the smaller flip is not only louder but sounds better due to speakers instead of the mono speaker in the charge ,21,5.0
positive,i got this speaker to upgrade from my old ue boom well would say the only things it does better is battery life and little more volume when you turn the jbl up to higher volumes while at work you can hear the low end effecting the highs and the speaker is very directional so it very difficult to find location for the speaker that doesn turn it into shrill little squeak box the ue have is much smaller speaker but it has nearly degrees of speakers so it sounds really great from all angles all in all the jbl definitely wasn worth the money sticking with ue ,108,5.0

positive,i originally heard this thing at christmas someone else got one as gift listening to them test it out it put out some amazing sound from such small device it does sound great but there are technical glitches that are really irritating the first second of sound cuts out until it wakes up from its bluetooth soft sleep like state guessing it to save battery life it supposed to have an app to tailor all kinds of controls but after installing it it refused to recognize the speaker no matter what did it paired fine can play music to it from my phone but communication with the app nope little bit of user oriented testing would ve gone long way here ,121,5.0

positive,amazing sound play it from the kitchen and can hear it in the bathroom light weight very portable,18,5.0
positive,i purchased this speaker over other portable options specifically because it had an aux input when using this input the speaker has the brilliant design of shutting off when the signal falls below certain threshold this threshold is very high and the the shut off happens basically immediately the result is continuous stuttering of whatever you re listening to which is absolutely unbearable searching online many people experience this some are able to solve it by cranking up the volume all the way up this didn work for me apparently you can remove resistor on the circuit board to disable this built in feature but just returned my unit instead jbl was useless when it came to customer support won be purchasing any products from them in the future and don recommend you do either ,135,5.0
neutral,after having the jbl flip for several years and loving it decided to upgrade and purchase the jbl charge bought it new and once it came in tested it out however the sound quality was extremely distorted and sounded like the speaker was already blown because the bass was so scratchy even at volume am not sure if this is an issue with the jbl charge or the individual speaker received either way will be returning this product and am very disappointed ,82,5.0
positive,picked up bluetooth fast and sound quality is amazing,9,5.0

positive,the speaker connected to my phone right away however it was very difficult to connect it to alexa and it didn work very smoothly had to go into the app to reconnect every time wanted to use it the main problem however is that it wouldn connect at all to the jbl app contacted customer service and they suggested resetting the speaker and explained how to do this followed the directions and the speaker behaved exactly as they said it would and then turned off success except not so much now the speaker won turn on at all hoping this is just defective device and when return it and receive my new one it will work much better if so will rate it again in more positive light added note once again was able to contact jbl customer service and they got the device working again it works perfectly except it still won connect to the jbl app after reading reviews of the app this is clearly failure of the app not the speaker love the speaker gave instead of only because of the problem with the jbl app ,189,5.0

negative,i ve had this speaker for less than year and have for the most part absolutely loved it use it in my car for long road trips and when the speakers in my laptop blew out started using it every day for podcasts etc from my laptop unfortunately the battery is just not holding charge it flashes red indicating low battery and then reads fully charged when plug it in after less than minute totally inaccurate as it reverts to flashing red again in about minutes very frustrating and ridiculously hard to change the battery myself don own the right tools so now in the market for new speaker ,109,5.0

positive,finally decided to buy portable speaker and not disappointed with my decision first time playing impressed me update after using the speaker for some time it not the best would recommend depends on the purpose the bt range is pretty incredible it gets the job done for being portable like others stated it mono with the two woofers battery seems to drain on me little quicker so make sure keep it charged after or during use ,76,5.0

neutral,i even bought replacement plan and still haven gotten new one one day it was fine then the next it just stopped working ,23,5.0
negative,maybe this is just personal preference but the single offset speaker is very distracting if you hold it in front of you you can immediately notice that there no sound coming from the left side initially thought maybe mine was defective as why would such an expensive device be mono did more research and learned it was designed that way the sound quality is still excellent just personally can look past the unequal sound distribution ,75,5.0

positive,i bought second speaker to have it in stereo but notice while having it that the other speaker cut off few seconds other then that it feels like brand new speaker if want true stereo need to by splitter and connect both as normal speakers for my laptop plus the syncing with youtube is pretty bad with videos it sounds clear and loud oh and one last thing about in stereo mode on and iphone it works with one app at time so use it on youtube for one day with the jbl connect and then use it with google music another day when you sync the stereo mode with the audio app you that you want to use it on windows its basically party mode and no real stereo mode did this with my laptop and one speaker sync in and the other sync in bit slower of seconds to sync in this is why give it stars but over rall can charge my phone or use each one as speaker louder then my phone cant use it as google or alexa voice activator or even siri but as two speakers in stereo is good on ios on my iphone but cant do it on windows ,207,5.0

neutral,phenomenal,1,5.0
positive,i ve tried other jbl bluetooth speakers in past years to be clear ve tried many dozens listened for hours tested usually reviewed and ve kept the ones that think have something special good sound thought after few more generations jbl may have figured out how to nail together decent thing was wrong buy bose soundlink mini listen to it figure out how to do better than that it has half the volume of this thing and sounds indisputably bigger better jbl don cry bose also completely beefed it with their own new generation revolve speakers they had spectacular speakers in the soundlink iii and especially the brilliant and nonpareil soundlink mini and decided to make the awful revolve speakers they may get notch louder and sound like muddy garbage but it round and that makes it better for parties congratulations we ve discovered idiocracy sony is even worse leading the charge into irrelevance starting with the srs and improving it by making the srs xb great bass for speaker its size if only great sound was produced by bass alone it doesn produce any midranges or treble speakers by idiots for idiots anyway jbl has never made great bluetooth speaker so suppose th generation speaker that still sucks isn really giving anything up just want the world to know that this speaker just ain great there better richer more articulate deep and mid bass in the bose soundlink mini at half the size it not waterproof and suppose people who need speakers with round cabinets probably also need to listen to music around pools most of the time and can figure out any effective way to prevent their speakers from falling in so maybe the jbl is great for certain type of person ,294,5.0
neutral,easy to carry around ,4,5.0
positive,great sound quality ,3,5.0
neutral,like it,2,4.0
positive,ok clearly this device is not an audiophile one arguably no bluetooth device is guess but really the high end is very lacking almost muffled sounding the low end is decent for device this size but it depends on where and how you position it against wall or corner tends to resonate better and gives better bass placed on the floor does the same and as others pointed out this is mono device ,73,5.0
neutral,battery stopped accepting charge after months of use submitted warranty request to jbl will see ,15,5.0
positive,love the sound quality really happy with this purchase there enough evidence and reviews on youtube to show how good these speakers are ,23,5.0
positive,i had high expectations for the jbl charge because it has lot of competition and gets good reviews it not exactly cheap either this implies that the charge should be optimistically almost as good as bose for example unfortunately not call me sonically spoiled use yamaha hs and hs monitors on isolation stands at home my truck has bose system that delivers bass mids and highs like reference system ve heard plenty of bose bluetooth speakers and they ve sounded good used to hearing everything crisp and clear having said all of that many people will hear this speaker and be blown away by the quality it not terrible and it actually sounds good in stereo with two connected together unfortunately it not that simple stereo mode is very unreliable and wonky with single charge the highs and mids sound pretty unappealing the best word can think of to describe its overall sound is flat and sloppy with punchy bass the sound stage is disappointingly one dimensional unless you buy second one and use jbl jbl connect app to run them in stereo stereo mode gives these charge an instant drastic improvement in sound but my speakers switch out of stereo mode and into party mode dual mono every time switch between apps and sometimes just from hitting pause for second this should have never made it past qa at jbl didn know that was happening at first but did notice that things went from sounding great to sounding terrible even with two connected that party mode it two copies of the same sounds right on top of each other don want that want left and right speakers that work reliably stereo mode gives wide stereo image and somehow balances out the lone charge inadequacies bit but can even count on it to work properly to summarize think the charge has potential to make good quality bluetooth audio solution but only if you plan on buying two and only if jbl improves stereo mode functionality right away the app should remember which mode the speakers were on and keep it that way or let us choose default mode either would help tremendously ,362,4.0

positive,awesome sound from small package,5,5.0
positive,i purchased one of these about months ago for regular use found the sound quality to be very good owned an older jbl speaker that failed within months the warranty return was hassle so am pleased that this model has performed well prefer that tactile buttons as it makes it easier to find buttons in dark situation as well as while driving also like the usb connection the older jbl with micro usb port failed from wear and tear can no longer charge that one and repairing it is not cost effective the only demerit can say is this unit is bit heavy to carry around and listen to music it more for placing in static location do want to note the sound does tend to come from one side of the unit it not it also isn stereo speaker that means one driver with channels merged not important for me the phone app allows for creating stereo sound from individual units verified that purchased nd unit during the holiday sale and would recommend this speaker to good friend ,179,5.0

negative,i returned the jbl charge for two reason first to my ears the sound has too much bottom music sounds muddy and the higher end is lost due to too much bass unfortunately there no way to adjust the bass and treble what you hear is what you re stuck with the second reason for my return is the awful electronic sound effects that play automatically when you turn the device on or off regardless of your streaming volume these sound effects are loud and completely unnecessary ,87,1.0

positive,prior to this had jbl flip for few years before it finally died decided to go for this charge rather than another flip since wanted little more volume out in the garage this charge has surpassed my expectations it significantly louder than the flip but never loses clarity even at high volumes the audio is clean and bass is very good as well the biggest surprise has been the battery life feel like the speaker gets used constantly but it only needs to be recharged once week or so it also waterproof which makes it super easy to clean all in all couldn be happier ,105,5.0

neutral,upon opening this speaker noticed it comes in very nice box the speaker seems durable and sounds amazing when it works right only had this for days used it the st day worked great come the rd day not so much it will play but cut out intermittently during songs speaker stays on it just literally stops when it wants to and plays when it wants to figure got lemon so ll try another might suggest don bother talking with support they will drive you insane just replace and move on ,91,5.0
negative,i would be as bothered by the fact the charge switched to mono if they would ve at least centered the damn speaker blows my mind the majority of people that buy this will probably think the thing is broken because of that no way would pay full price for the charge when the is stereo much cheaper and likely sounds better ,62,5.0

positive,love it,2,5.0
negative,i bought this because wanted portable speaker with an old fashioned aux input unfortunately the aux input has horrible flaw if couple seconds of silence go by in whatever you re listening too the speaker shuts off and only starts back up after it gets some signal again you ll lose about half second of audio as it turns on again too like let say you re listening to an album couple seconds of silence between tracks is enough to cause this and you ll lose the first little bit of the folllowing song because it shuts off and then turns on again only after something loud enough to turn it back on again happens so so annoying after little internet sleuthing found out that this is just how they are apparently you can fix it by shorting chip on the motherboard but not doing that returning it rip jbl really dumb ,152,5.0

positive,initially my preference was the bose soundlink mini ii with its smooth notes and decent sound quality in small transportable package that is until heard comparison against jbl charge on youtube based on that review and others purchased this speaker for its waterproof multi connect and sound great price you can buy charge direct from jbl for with color options with price point being on par with amazon sounds great excellent better describes it if you have charge there isn enough improvement to justify buying charge the charge went from two smaller speakers to one slightly larger speaker which improved bass frequency from hz to deeper hz when the jbl arrived we conducted our own comparison against bose soundlink mini ii and wow the charge is much clearer has better frequency response and has better sound presence in the room it bit larger and heavier than the soundlink mini ii which might turn some off but to me if going to carry any speaker like this then taking the same care and am sure can find just little more room good packaging but no instructions not that charging and setup are all that difficult but this is my first device that requires usb first anything that arrived with zero printed information and rechargeable device that arrived with zero anything to charge it with setup was easy bought usb cable from the nearest gas station and plugged it in for hours since it came somewhat charged already once charged press the bluetooth button then connect to your phone or other device for settings always recommend phone volume to be no more than to volume then using the charge volume from there this affords you plenty of up down volume adjustment remotely from your phone and doesn task the internal sound processor this since it cheaper to replace repair charge than an expensive smartphone you and someone else can be bluetooth paired to this speaker at the same time battery life the built in rechargeable li ion mah battery is strong not only does it support up to hours of playtime at lowest setting and figure hours at half volume but it will also charge your phone and other devices via the usb port strongly suggest buying protective case for it which will hold your charger usb charging cable and any spare usb cable needed for cell phones it has the same ipx waterproof as iphone samsung or other higher end smartphone we place it on the deck without any worries of accidents from fluid spills big splashes being left in the rain or even an accidental swim in the pool having that peace of mind alone is priceless jbl connect with connect you can connect several of these to together for full sound experience put in opposing corners of large room in different rooms indoor and outdoors heck even in your car if your current stereo or speakers are crap bottom line this being my first bluetooth speaker ever and having friends that have made different choices for the speakers they have have zero regrets with my purchase after hearing it beside theirs bang for buck is spot on have excellent sound in transportable package in wireless speaker that is rugged waterproof and allows multiple speakers as well as people to connect now proudly own the party favorite speaker for socials events and private enjoyment win ,565,5.0

neutral,for the size it got nice punch to the bass but the high ends are slightly muffled,17,5.0
positive,sound quality is absolutely great for its size it can really fill space sometimes leave it playing in my room and go outside and it almost sounds like have whole mini hi fi stereo system in there the bass is very good but can also be tremendous if you position it right place it in corner where it can bounce the sound off the walls etc and prepare to be amazed it slightly bigger than the charge but probably the price you pay for bigger sound it really hasn affected the portability for me just throw it in my backpack and go it pretty durable haven dropped it but had paint droplets splash on it and was able to wipe it off with damp cloth perfectly and also sand etc comes out of it easily after day at the beach my only gripe is the single speaker that is contained in the housing is off to one side so sometimes if you re right in front of the speaker close enough to it you may hear bias towards the left side other than that totally excellent speaker never really charged my phone on it beyond few minutes but it works and the battery life feels super long especially if you re not playing it constantly honestly just excited now waiting to see how jbl is going to improve on this in future models ,233,5.0

negative,unboxed this today and couldn listen for more than an hour muted sound no treble just overloaded with bass removing the extra bass with the bluetooth volume reduction buttons combo to produce flat sound didn help jbl hk should invest in an eq app asap to allow users increase the higher frequencies to produce their preferred output balance can even live with just preset eq settings but not this jbl didn listen to all the charge criticisms about sound quality very disappointing packaging back up to return total waste of time,91,5.0

positive, this speaker sounds great thumpy punchy and in certain instances has deep booming bass mids highs are clear could be little more crisp and of course have more bass but it is full rich sound and using an eq brings out more of its capabilities jbl quality construction was on the fence about buying this because they went to mono driver but you can really tell difference in fidelity you can tell the bass is slightly deeper than the charge completely happy with it and love the green color one thing do not like is they took away the speaker phone put the speakerphone back that thing like and is missing on this as for connecting to older speakers with connect you can update the older speakers to connect plus to connect with the charge update liked it so much got another one camo these sound great it actually has bass no issues with connectivity or battery this is the best speaker in this class or category there are some that come close but these can be beat the price hike is downer don know what going on there that crazy got these for and that what they should be seems getting good reviews helps their sales and they take advantage by jacking up the price not cool at they aren that great would expect more at that price ,229,4.0

positive,i ve been around music my entire life including spinning records at top nightclubs where jbl was the speaker of choice really wanted to love this speaker but it not happening jbl should be ashamed of themselves the sound quality is horrible the speaker clips at between and of the volume using my phone at way the speaker music coming out is missing everything including clarity bass treble yes stereo everyone with reviews complaining about dead music coming out is absolutely correct the speaker plays dead music especially at higher volumes anyone wanting cheap portable speaker with horrible sound this is for you anyone looking for great speaker this is not for you yes you get what you pay for but with today technology every speaker should sound great take look at the marshall bluetooth speakers they re amazing also if you don need portability the klipsch speakers are amazing sonos is overrated find myself always going back to the good old names from decades ago even the bose speaker selling for around on sale right now at bb sounds better than these jbl speakers folks take look at the bose marshall bt speakers you ll really enjoy the sound especially from the marshall woburn ii have the bose soundtouch the speaker blows away every speaker on the market also had the marshall stanmore hooked up to my phone and computer it rocked if you can find the old bose acoustic wave in mint condition that was once an amazing speaker too hope this review helps you thanks for reading it ,261,5.0

positive,a lot of people were jumping on this speaker for the fact that it is mono speaker and just wanted to stand up for it you can hardly tell the difference between the and the unless you stand very close the two stereo speakers in the charge are just so close together it doesn really matter and the difference is small the sound quality is definitely improved however the mid and highs are not muddy like the and the bass is slightly deeper making very enjoyable sound experience the only gripe have about it is that it cannot be speakerphone or connect with siri or google assistant but that is minimal compared to the improvement of sound quality if you have the don upgrade it still isn worth it but if you are deciding between getting the or the get the ,141,5.0
positive,attached it to my bike for ragbrai works great like that its waterproof has long battery life charges my phone if needed and syncs with other jbl speakers within typical ft bluetooth range it gets pretty loud when you want it to but note that it only has one speaker so its mono not stereo sound unless you pair up two of them ,63,5.0

positive, sound battery life build quality led too bright don time out they have daisy chain feature you can use but it been hit miss with us these speakers are fantastic for the price we bought of the charge and charge the only reason these aren star for us is that the primary use is in the bedroom to play sleep stories music the leds for buttons on top never time out while the speaker is turned on and are sooo bright in dark room unfortunately we have to drape something over the top of the speaker to hide the lights stars if that weren an issue as for battery life use one in my office all week for conference calls with desk mic and charge it only every other week fantastic ,131,5.0

positive,great product great sound,4,5.0
negative,although just yesterday ordered the jbl charge and so haven received it yet did some research into how the device charges on one end of the charging cable is the new and better type of usb connector usb and on the other the standard well familiar usb connector the charging port on the speaker only accepts the new type of usb connector known as usb not the standard usb that we are well familiar with however the unit comes supplied with sided cable that will plug into standard usb port such as on most or all home and office computers and also some ac wall chargers the speaker does not come with this necessary usb accepting ac wall charger so if you do not have one already you have to buy one someplace otherwise simply plug it into usb port on computer the new type of usb connector usb is better because it is the same all around that is you no longer need to worry if the jack is orientated properly before inserting it ll work no matter which way you plug it in much convenient design over the old think but am not sure that it might also work faster than the old and familiar usb connector however at least as of now there is still standard usb connector on the other end of the cable so perhaps the faster charging speeds assuming even correct on this might only be the case when these cables have the new type of usb usb connectors on both ends in any case as is it still better than the standard usb because of not having to fumble around when attempting to plug it in not only is it annoying fumbling around with the old standard usb connectors the fumbling can actually damage the insides of usb port due to repeated attempts at trying to insert an improperly orientated connector like trying to force square peg into round hole after while the inners of the port will get bent out of shape however this is much more of problem with the standard mini usb connectors commonly used with mobile phones and many other small devices ,363,5.0

positive,update definitely noticeable sound differences between the speakers the model is flatter and doesn get as loud as the model it also has muffled sound to it so far have received bad customer service from jbl the seller bought from electronics expo an authorized dealer has week return policy so outside of that and thus far jbl won even admit they are selling different models to customers sent pictures and even links to fcc filing pages and the customer service reps don even acknowledge it they want me to do factory resets and firmware updates it different hardware all they offered me was some coupon and told me to deal with the seller this is the last time ll ever purchase jbl product and surely will urge friends and family to steer clear of them as well original pictures included just so people are aware there are different models of the actual speaker you may get with this it seems legitimate based on the fcc filings page but want people to understand in case they notice differences like did when put them side by side the model number on the box itself is the same jblchargeblkam but jbl is shipping different speakers inside the box and not telling people there is model and model the boxes themselves are nearly identical besides the small qr code next to the serial number on the model if you open the charging port flap and look on the left side next to the serial number you will see which one you have now if you only order one speaker you probably never know but if you order of them and receive different models the differences are obvious charges the looks to be the older model according to fcc filings this has mah battery inside from my personal observations the mesh on the outside is thicker and you cannot see through it at all it also feels bit heavier in the hand don have digital scale to measure exactly but it definitely more dense the charging indicator lights are also much brighter you can see this in the pictures chargej the seems to be the newer model this is the model that actually has mah battery inside the mesh is not as thick on this model and you can easily see the speaker components inside also the charging lights on this model are much dimmer compared to the it feels bit lighter in the hand as well haven put them through the ringer yet to see if there are audio differences it would be very disappointing if there are so buyer beware jbl is selling different speakers with different battery sizes that potentially sound different but they are marketing it as the same product wish would have known this before bought them ,467,5.0

positive,i purchased the jbl charge because of reviews had also purchased ue megaboom not the newer megaboom the two were equally priced so it came down to sound and features the jbl allows for charging device and for using plug in direct jack instead of bluetooth thought those were more important when ordered it until listened to them side by side had listeners and switched back and forth between them using same songs the other listeners liked the megaboom better but couldn identify why found the megaboom to have tighter bass and much better transparent mids and highs the charge sounded muddy in lows mids highs in comparison alone it can sound okay as long as you don have competitive reference sound quality beat out battery charging and the aux input ,131,5.0
positive,as woman in today society it is hard to find the time to clean and cook but now having speaker that plays my audio of choice it definitely helps to motivate those actions can wait to clean next saturday this is awesome it can go any where with you and is water resistant hhello shower concerts simply hook up your bluetooth device to the speaker and your ready ,68,5.0

neutral,was looking for speaker to blast out the neighbors who sit too close at the beach think found it in the jbl charge stay tuned ,25,1.0
positive,i upgraded from jbl flip that couldn hold charge after about years was hesitant about buying speaker that has only driver but so far have zero complaints run speakers hard at my job and this one has no difficulty at all keeping up with the challenges give it it has huge battery that will certainly last you for hours have currently used it for roughly hours at work today at higher volumes and it claims to still be near full charge only time will tell another cool thing these speakers can do is connect to other speakers that have the same jbl connect feature other coworkers have compatible speakers that they love to hook up to it and it certainly turns work into party would highly recommend this speaker if you re looking for something that puts out high volume and has great battery life ,145,3.0

neutral,i have been musician my entire life and this thing sounds like utter garbage compared similar jbl speakers the one speaker is just horrible go to store and try for yourself even the old link is better sounding ,38,5.0
positive,the jbl charge is great product found it to be initially disappointing due to the warm sound signature have found that the highs aren totally accurate but they re close enough to not distract you from the music the highs are present but definitely aren strong which adds to the warm signature the mids are very good and exceptionally clear for the size of this device because of this the vocals are great in most songs they are well represented unless they sneak up on the high notes which is when you can hear slight distortion from accuracy however the vocals which dip into lower range sound really good as the speaker does great job not to put too much emphasis on the radiators making it sound bassy and unrealistic if you listen to high quality hifi tracks you ll be able to imagine the singer right in front of you because of the presence and sound stage as for the mono speaker don listen to the critics of this new implementation because most of them either don know what they re talking about or they are just picking at it because they don like the thought of it you re not going to get stereo by using speakers inches apart like on the last model and as for separation this mono speaker separates just fine if not better than the last model especially in mid to lows the speaker gets plenty loud for the average person and it manages to maintain its dynamics all the way to just under full volume ve compared this speaker to many others such as charge xb xb xb extreme onyx and what ve found is that while the highs are bit lacking in certain songs it certainly makes up for it in other departments the bass is very good in the charge the bass notes are represented accurately and it able to hit lower frequencies most portable speakers of this size can however it worth mentioning it still no sub this speaker has trouble representing very low frequencies the radiators start shaking instead of making music which for those of you who don know this doesn sound very good the battery life of this speaker wasn as advertised and found could only get hours on percent volume which isn bad but is huge deviation from the claimed hours after using this speaker for awhile and comparing it to other speakers ve actually grown fond of this unit and it become my beach toy don take any critics in this review too seriously as doubt most people are as critical as me when it comes to audio but this one gets my thumbs up future improvements would definitely require tweeter and possibly bigger battery ,460,4.0
positive,i never looked into jbl before this sound quality is amazing durability is top notch it is sleek and not to bulky have not tested out the waterproof part but think leave that for another time the battery lasts very long time like it says hrs it also great backup portable charger for my phone kinda wish got the bigger one just because really liked this brand this is me saying this not someone telling me to say it but if you like protecting your things would also get the carrying case will upload picture at another time ,98,5.0

neutral,i had intended on buying megaboom but got to test out this speaker along with boom and megaboom and the fullness of sound in particular the quality of the bass on this thing blew those two out of the water the non universal charge cord is little annoying but oh well don expect to get sub bass out of this thing it would have to be about inches taller for that ,71,5.0

positive,my brother has pair of jbl extremes and they sound great outdoors didn want to go that big and expensive so after some research purchased pair of charge one from amazon with points and one from meijer store at big discount knew that separately they are mono but planned on getting two paired them with my iphone downloaded the connect app and tried them out in my breezeway and wasn terribly impressed but that room has cedar walls and ceiling and all hard furniture so moved out to the patio incredible sound played some aaron diehl tom waits jade bird several genres exceeded my expectations after listening to just one speaker would say this might not be what you want if you re going to use one solo would probably consider the charge in that case but if you connect at least two speakers for stereo sound you won be disappointed ,151,5.0

positive,update from stars to was having trouble with the jbl connect app but now got it figured out do not have more than connected devices at one time otherwise the app will not work once the app worked could now turn off the audio prompt which was annoying when especially you don want to disturb anyone now the start up and volume either reached maximum or minimum does not give me the unwanted feedback nice note my experience with this speaker was less than hrs also it didn been through water test just so you guys know only single sound driver could tell sound was coming from more from the right side when had the speaker feet away from me and that my preferred use that was already little unpleasant next issue was the jbl connect app didn work at all it couldn find the speaker what lastly and most importantly used my speaker lot listening to audio book before go to bed when this speaker volume was down to say maybe or so could hear random breaking up background noise coming off it that was my last draw and unfortunately had to return it what would like to is that the light indicator can be controlled via the app but since couldn use the app wasn sure if the light indicator could be off or dim somehow it is way too bright and unnecessary also if possible led indicator to show the level of the current volume it does not have to permanently turned on but fade away after second or two that will be way better jbl jbl oh no ,272,5.0

positive,the big debate about this speaker not being stereo like the charge is really mute point when the speakers on the charge are only few inches away from each other anyway not enough stereo separation to make any difference in real world listening environments in my opinion found the sound quality and loudness of the to be very impressive for such small package and would not use the fact that it only has one main speaker in front affect your buying decision at all great little speaker and long battery life just what was looking for,96,5.0
neutral,the power button has become unable to work it feels like the button has been pushed in and cannot turn on my jbl ,23,4.0
positive,i bought this because wanted to get good bluetooth speaker and debated between this and the ue boom because they are about the same price after doing little research figured that the jbl would sound better and surprised the jbl sounds really good good bass at low volumes great mids and highs for portable speaker it does distort slightly when you get bass heavy song using spotify built in eq with bass boost but nothing little eq can solve it turns the bass down when you are close to max volume to protect itself which is nice and it still sounds decent at max volume range is awesome can walk about feet away before it starts cutting out hopefully it lasts will update review if it breaks from normal use or anything like that but so far so good ,139,5.0
